**Thank you, SOTA Parents!**  
  
From helping out at our Open House to whipping up great desserts for teachers and preparing sumptuous dinners for Year 6s, SOTA is fortunate to have parents who are passionate about providing support to enrich the environment for their childrenâ€™s learning. Made up of parent volunteers, the SOTA Parents Support Group (PSG) has been very supportive of school events and has planned and coordinated many activities in 2018.  
  
On 21 Sep 2018, a gathering was organised to thank all parent volunteers who have contributed their time and efforts to PSG events and activities. School and alumni representatives were also invited to the gathering. It was a fun-filled gathering with plenty of laughter and memories that will be cherished.  
  
Thank you, SOTA Parents!
