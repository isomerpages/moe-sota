This year, we had the help of volunteers from the SOTA Parent Support Group in answering questions from potential parents at our Open Symposium, which included questions on financial assistance schemes (read more [here](/admissions/sfs-scholarships/)). The parent volunteers also took the opportunity to help the school raise funds by selling SOTA merchandise.

Thank you, parents, for your invaluable support for the school! For SOTA parents who wish to find out more about being a parent volunteer, please click [here](/getting-involved/parents/) for more information.
