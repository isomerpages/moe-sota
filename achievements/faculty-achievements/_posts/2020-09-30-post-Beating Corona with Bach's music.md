Music alumna Brenda Koh (Class of 2013), faculty member Cheryl Lim, and adjunct Gabriel Lee performed at Red Dot Baroque's concert,&nbsp;_Bach Beats Corona_&nbsp;in September this year. Inspired by the worldwide #BachAgainstCorona movement that has recently risen within these pandemic times, the concert celebrates J.S. Bach's music, known and celebrated for its spiritual and cleansing nature. With a pay-as-you-wish ticketing system, the concert was streamed live on SISTIC.
