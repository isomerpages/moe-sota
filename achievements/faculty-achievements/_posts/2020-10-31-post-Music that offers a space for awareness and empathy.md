Music faculty member Ramu Thiruyanam and adjuncts Eugene Toh, Joachim Lim and Tan Lee Ying performed "I Am Fluent In Silence", written by Singaporean composer Madeleine Tan. The piece, inspired by "The Girl from Ipanema" by Frank Sinatra and written for bowed vibraphones, tells the story of a lady in a world on her own, due to her inner struggles. Written with the intention of shedding light on mental health, it offers a space of awareness and empathy.
