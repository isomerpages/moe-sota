### Par excellence

A 450m2 space at the gateway to Singapore's arts and entertainment district, the **SOTA Art Gallery** is designed as a white box that provides an ideal backdrop for exhibits and displays. Located strategically along a public thoroughfare, it conveniently occupies the same level (2nd storey) as the formal entrance drop off, with direct access to the loading/unloading bay. The SOTA Art Gallery is supported by an informal performance area in its generous foyer space as well as adjacent back of house administrative and storage spaces.  
  

### Adjustable

The gallery features a 3.6m high ceiling and is fitted with a professional adjustable track lighting system. Operable walls along the facade further provide flexibility for the Art Gallery to be infused with natural daylight through a feature curtain wall if desired.
