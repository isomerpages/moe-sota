### Artistic

The interiors - a textured material palette of matt black off-form concrete walls with highlights of blackened steel along the balustrades - exudes a sense of raw aesthetics that incites the imagination and evokes creative self-expression.  
  

### Customised

A combination of 200-person retractable seating unit and additional loose seating offer flexibility for multi-configurational theatre formats.  
  

### Box-in-Box

Built using a box-in-box construction, the enclosure of the Studio Theatre is carefully isolated to minimise transmission of structural borne vibration and air borne noise.  
  

### Comprehensive

The room is equipped with a complete audio-visual and production lighting infrastructure to facilitate performances in any configuration.A mezzanine gallery all round affords added flexibility for stage production set up while technical access at high level is via a tension wire grid, allowing for safe access to production lighting and scenery rigging without the use of ladders.
