### Performing Arts Venues

Envisioned as jewels embedded within a gargantuan mass of stone, carved out and chiselled to reveal dynamic volumes in various proportions, are three main performing arts venues at School of the Arts, Singapore. The in-between cavernous voids define the theatre pre-function foyers of the **Studio Theatre**, **Drama Theatre**, and **Music Auditorium**, set amidst several smaller informal performing spaces and art galleries.
