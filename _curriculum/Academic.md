SOTA’s integrated arts and academic curriculum emphasises meaningful learning that provides for experimentation, expression, and discovery across both arts and academic disciplines. The rigorous curriculum stimulates students to be intellectually curious and equips them with the knowledge, conceptual understanding, life skills, reflective practices, and attitudes needed to be autonomous lifelong learners.
