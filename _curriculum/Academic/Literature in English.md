Literature in English seeks to create well-rounded learners who are equipped for the future.  
  
Students will explore local and global writing. This will ground them in issues concerning Singapore society while exposing them to universal concerns. Through developing a sensitivity to the nuances of language, students identify and explore different ways in which texts convey complex ideas. They learn about empathy, compassion, and interpersonal relationships through individual and collaborative work. At the same time, students also make connections within and between texts and contexts, while expressing their thoughts in speech and writing.  
  
This prepares students with skills such as linguistic precision and effective, persuasive communication, which are increasingly important in our complex world.  
  
In the IB Diploma Programme, students choose to offer Literature or Language and Literature at either the Higher or Standard Levels, or Literature and Performance at the Standard Level. Literature allows students to explore the nature of literature, and the aesthetic function of literary language while in Language and Literature, students study a wide range of literary and non-literary texts in a variety of media. Literature and Performance allows students to combine literary analysis with performance to further develop their understanding of dramatic literature.
