The SOTA Science curriculum seeks to nurture the inquirer and creative thinker in science. Students are introduced to scientific inquiry and the basics of biology, chemistry and physics, before they venture into more complex topics during their IB Diploma Programme. They are encouraged to make meaningful connections between science and real-world phenomena, as well as apply their learning in the arts. They learn about the impact and implications of using science and technology in society, as well as the possibilities and limitations associated with science and the work of scientists.
