The SOTA Mathematics curriculum offers a wide variety of topics, with the aim of equipping students with the mathematical skills they will need to make sense of the world they live in. Macro-concepts like pattern, space, change, and system are discussed in the classroom, and opportunities such as performance tasks are given to students to explore and apply Mathematics in the real world. An arts integrated approach is also infused into the Mathematics curriculum to allow students to explore the artistic and cultural perspectives of Mathematics.
