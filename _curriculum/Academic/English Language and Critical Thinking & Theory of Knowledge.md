English Language and Critical Thinking (Years 1-4) and Theory of Knowledge (Years 5-6) set the foundation for students to become:  
&nbsp;

*   Inquiring learners and critical thinkers who can analyse and evaluate multiple perspectives and text types;
*   Individuals who show empathy and respect;
*   Effective communicators in the use of standard English Language;
*   Artist learners who apply what is learnt in the classroom to their art forms and vice versa

  
Through English Language and Critical Thinking (ELCT) lessons in Years 1-4, students will learn to analyse a variety of real-world issues, discuss multiple perspectives on these issues, be empathetic and respectful about othersâ€™ views and opinions, and learn to communicate their views effectively through various platforms.  
  
In ELCT, through a deliberate and progressive scaffolding of activities and lessons, students learn the basics of research skills. In Year 4, students are prepared to embark on independent research to help them gain an understanding of the demanding research skills they would need in their IB years.  
  
From Years 5-6 in Theory of Knowledge, one of the three core components in the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP), students will examine the nature of knowledge; how knowledge is constructed; and reflect on how we know what we know.  
  
In Personal and Professional Skills, one of the four core components in the IB Career-related Programme (IBCP), students are taught life skills to help further develop as critical thinkers and communicators with deep appreciation for cultural diversity.
