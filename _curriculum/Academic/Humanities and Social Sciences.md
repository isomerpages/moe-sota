Through the Humanities and Social Sciences, students cultivate a healthy curiosity about the study of humanity, cultures, and societies as they develop research, analytical, and communication skills.  
  
A key feature of the Humanities and Social Sciences education in SOTA is the emphasis on learner-centred, inquiry-based pedagogies as well as experiential learning to provide a platform for rich and engaged learning. Through these experiences, students are encouraged to recognise their roles as local and global citizens who are active contributors to society and the environment.
