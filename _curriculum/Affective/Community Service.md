The SOTA Community Service programme aims to prepare students for lifelong learning and community engagements. It serves to prepare students to participate fully in today and tomorrowâ€™s world demands. Through the pedagogy of experiential learning, it seeks to develop students who will learn to appreciate and respect social-cultural diversity, and demonstrate respect and care for the community. We strongly encourage SOTA students to use their artistic talents to partner and advocate for the larger good, and demonstrate the zest for challenge, adventure, and creative endeavours.  
  
SOTA students are introduced to local service and experiential learning community and issues-based projects in Year 3, leading towards more rigorous community engagement projects at Year 4. These programmes will pave the way for the Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) or Service Learning (SL) projects they will undertake during Years 5 and 6. CAS and SL are, respectively, one of the core components of the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP) and IB Career-related Programme (IBCP).
