In SOTA’s Experiential Education, students develop knowledge, skills and values through purposefully crafted physical and outdoor experiences. A key feature of experiential learning is the focus on direct experiences to foster students’ growth in their physical, kinesthetic and affective domains. Through these experiences, we hope that students will become independent and self-directed learners who have a passion for physical pursuits.
