    <div>
      <p><img style="width:60%" src="/images/2015-almirafarid.jpg"></p>
			<p>Almira had always been dedicated to serving the SOTA community from her early days at SOTA. She joined the student senate and eventually became the President of the school's student leadership committee. Within the Music faculty, she used her natural leadership to bring students together, facilitating a community of young artists. <br><br>
Almira demonstrated a close connection with music of her culture as well as its role in contemporary society. She performed on the Sundanese flute for a SOTA theatre production of Medea, and she had a 6-week Javanese Gamelan course with the National University of Singapore Gamelan Ensemble. As a classical musician, she took lessons in Baroque recorder and trained to be a highly accomplished Marimba performer during her time at SOTA. She made her professional debut as a singer at the Hong Kong New Vision Arts Festival, singing in Singaporean composer, Mark Chan's operetta, Flight of the Jade Bird (2012), which was first performed at the Singapore Arts Festival earlier that year. <br><br>
When Almira was studying ethnomusicology at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London on a scholarship from MOE, she started a radio show with SOAS radio station called Songs from Southeast Asia (SFSEA) with a few of her coursemates. During her internship with the Singapore Teachers' Academy for the aRts (STAR) in 2017, she worked on Stories We Sing, a pedagogical music resource produced as a collaboration between STAR under MOE and NAC. It was the first time that educators and artists have come together like this in the creation of 12 commissioned songs in English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil, with the aim of enhancing quality music education in schools, while also promoting local artists and exploring the Singapore soundscape.</p>

    <label for="accordion3">2016 - Nur Sabrina Binte Dzulkifli, Theatre</label>
    <div>
      <p><img style="width:60%" src="/images/2016-sabrina.jpg"></p>
			<p>Since winning the TheatreWorks 24-Hour Playwriting Competition (Youth Category) in 2012, Sabrina has been developing her craft continuously. A reworked version of her winning play, Of Babies (not really) and People was selected by Theatreworks for a professional tour of local community centres in 2013, and she was commissioned by M1 Singapore Fringe Festival to co-write BI(CARA), a play about humans’ relationships with animals. She also worked on Under My Skin, a play about post-natal depression with Singapore-based director Alessandra Fel for the same festival. <br><br>
Besides writing, Sabrina also has interests in directing and collaborative devised work. Her directing credits include student productions of Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (2013) and Majulah, Comrats! (2015) where she explored with elements such as mask work, physicality and multimedia. In her artistry, she hopes to explore other languages of storytelling, incorporating interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary work. <br><br>
Counting, staged in 2016, was the product of Sabrina’s year-long stint as resident playwright at Woodlands Regional Library where she was mentored by playwright Joel Tan. Broadening her aesthetic range, she also worked as a co-curator on the 2015 Waterloo Open Call exhibition, which aimed to invite visual artists from SOTA to produce work in a site-specific space. <br><br>
In 2017, Sabrina became the first recipient of the inaugural Singapore Unbound Fellowship Award which provided her the opportunity to visit New York City for two weeks to work on a writing project. She eventually pursued her undergraduate studies in drama and literature at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. She hopes to continue to inspire the community she belongs to, be it the larger Singaporean community, or the more specific Malay-Muslim community, to engage and enjoy the arts.</p>

    <label for="accordion4">2017 - Cally Tan Ying Tong, Visual Arts</label>
    <div>
      <p><img style="width:60%" src="/images/2017-callytan.jpg"></p>
			<p>Nicknamed the ‘Chili Padi’ for her energy and tenacity, no project was ever too big for Cally, as she demonstrated in Year 3, when she made a pastel drawing three times bigger than she was.<br><br>
Cally's artistic practice, anchored in social engagement and textile work, was inspired by her observation of the communal nature of batik painting in Pekalongan, Indonesia, during her Overseas Service Learning (OSL) trip in Year 4. Since then, a crucial aspect of her art-making has been the inclusion of participants in her works, which stems from her belief that every person possesses the capacity to create in meaningful ways. Through participation, her audiences are transformed from passive observers to co-creators, their own experiences becoming an integral part of the works. In doing so, she hopes to create a platform for her participants, who may not be exposed to or engaged in the arts, to ponder about the relevance of the works to themselves, and of art in their lives. <br><br>
Cally was selected for the National Arts Council’s Noise Art Mentorship (NAM) programme in 2016, and for the NAM showcase Proposals for Waterloo, held in January 2017 at Waterloo Centre, she collaborated with residents of the building to design and weave carpets for the shared staircase landings between adjacent flats that both reflected the identities and aspirations of their residents, and demonstrated how neighbours negotiated the dynamics of shared spaces. The eventual work, Carpets: Study of the Staircase Landing won her the Noise Singapore Award, a grant for the top young artists from Noise’s mentorship programmes to embark on and take their creative development to the next level.<br><br>
Cally is currently studying textile design in Tokyo.</p>

In 2015 and 2017, Zachary had the opportunity to attend the Summer Programme at the International Vocal Artists Academy of Payerbach, Austria as part of SOTA’s Arts Excellence Programme. He learnt so much from the students and teachers there that it affirmed his determination to become a professional singer. <br><br>
Zachary’s time at SOTA not only exposed him to a rigorous artistic training, but also influenced his purpose for music. During a school service-learning trip to a Cambodian orphanage and at a local service-learning stint, he taught children choral music, and was so inspired by their that he decided that he would work towards making classical music more accessible in Singapore through music programmes in the heartlands for children.<br><br>

    <label for="accordion7">2020 - Elizabeth Goh Wan Tian, Music</label>
    <div>
      <p><img style="width:60%" src="/images/2020-elizabeth.jpg"></p>
			<p>Elizabeth is a passionate individual whose focused diligence and desire for self-exploration have contributed to her achievements as both a pianist and a leader.<br><br>
Over the years, Elizabeth has performed actively in SOTA showcases and external events, such as the Temasek Philanthropic Appreciation Lunch (2018). Beyond the classroom, Elizabeth had the chance to study under renowned artists during summer music programmes in the United States (2016) and France (2018), supported by SOTA’s Arts Excellence Programme (AEP). Her strong will to push her limits also led her to clinch prizes in local and overseas competitions. In 2018 and 2019, she won the SOTA Concerto Competition, which gave her the opportunity to perform as a soloist with the Orchestra of the Music Makers (OMM) twice.<br><br>
Elizabeth is appreciative of the rich and holistic education in SOTA. The rigorous training nurtured her maturity, technique, and understanding of music. Influenced by an environment that encouraged experimentation, Elizabeth explored a diverse and sometimes unconventional repertoire, including jazz and avant-garde music. Moreover, she has a keen interest in collaborative music thanks to numerous opportunities to perform with various vocalists and instrumentalists in SOTA.<br><br>
Unifying her passion for both the arts and leadership, Elizabeth took up many opportunities to serve the wider community. In her service learning trips to Cambodia (2018 and 2019), she explored ways of incorporating music and art into academic lessons for primary school students. The team also sought to create sustainable and accessible means of music-making, which opened Elizabeth’s eyes to the ways in which music can transcend socio-economic boundaries. In 2018, Elizabeth led TONES, a (non-classical) music event aimed at raising awareness of the local music scene by providing a platform for aspiring musicians to showcase their music. By serving communities of various backgrounds, Elizabeth has broadened her perspective on her role as a musician in today’s society.<br><br>
People-centredness, one of SOTA’s core values, remains intrinsic to Elizabeth’s nature and motivation. She believes that music is a two-way exchange, and aspires to engage audiences in meaningful, conversational experiences with music. With her versatility, Elizabeth also hopes to foster a collective openness towards classical music in Singapore by performing a wide range of repertoire and educating the public.<br><br>
Elizabeth is pursuing her studies in Music Performance in Amsterdam, where she hopes to hone her musicianship and sharpen her artistic vision.

    <label for="accordion8">2021 - Alicia Diva Chandra, Music</label>
    <div>
      <p><img style="width:60%" src="/images/2021-alicia.jpg"></p>
			<p>Alicia does not view her pursuit of excellence in music as hard work, but rather as a constant learning journey. Eager to explore new ideas in music, Alicia's consistency and enthusiasm in learning has helped her grow to be a versatile musician, both as a composer and performer.<br><br>
Apart from her major study – the piano – Alicia showed an avid interest in other musical instruments too. She joined the school's Chinese Percussion Ensemble and Contemporary Percussion Ensemble to learn more about other instruments, perform on them, and play as part of an ensemble. Outside of the school curriculum, Alicia continued to explore other collaborative music-making opportunities to diversify her musical repertoire and develop herself as a performer, such as performing in pop music bands with her peers and joining an a cappella group.<br><br>
As a composer, Alicia was able to experiment with alternative ways of presenting her ideas and developed clarity and expression in her works. Her experience so far spans from composing for a wide range of instruments, music arranging for a cappella groups and a full orchestra, to creating electronic music and interdisciplinary works with other artists. She has benefitted from the broad range of music context, history and theory covered in SOTA's holistic Music curriculum.<br><br>
The aspiring composer constantly seeks opportunities to learn more and challenge herself. She has since participated in programmes including the Young Composers' Programme at the Cleveland Institute of Music (2017), University of Missouri Kansas City (UMKC) Composition Workshop (2019), Singapore Symphony Orchestra Orchestration Workshop with Tim Davies (2020), and Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music's Young Composers' Academy (2020). Her development as a young composer culminated in being selected at the Music at the Anthology (MATA) Jr. 2020. Her String Quartet was one of the six works performed by Bergamot Quartet in New York. <br><br>
Inspired by her fulfilling Music education experience at SOTA, Alicia was keen to give back to the community by sharing her knowledge with others. In 2019, she launched Music Theory CAS, a Creativity, Activity, Service project where students taught other students music theory. She was motivated to help fellow Music students improve on music theory and to also share the joy of learning music with students from other artforms. From organising lessons and overseeing student-teachers, to personally engaging with the learners, Alicia displayed leadership and a potential for teaching.<br><br>
SOTA has helped Alicia solidify her dreams as an artist. Alicia is grateful to her teachers for their patience and guidance, and cherishes the many opportunities she had to grow as a performer, composer and musician. Alicia will be pursuing Composition at Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, where she hopes to hone her craft and find her voice as an artist.</p>

Timothy developed a desire to pursue music professionally through his education at SOTA. He developed greater confidence in playing the viola, making the most of every opportunity to hone his technical skills and musicality. His performances with the Singapore National Youth Orchestra (SNYO) and Orchestra of the Music Makers (OMM) allowed him to collaborate with like-minded individuals and gain invaluable experience. Timothy also harnessed his musical talents to contribute to the wider community, organising various service learning projects where he taught music to students and less privileged children.<br><br>
After completing his National Service, he plans to pursue a Bachelor of Music Degree in Viola performance in an overseas conservatoire before returning to Singapore to play as an orchestral musician.</p>
