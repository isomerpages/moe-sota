Students specialising in Music will experience the spectrum of music, from voice and instrumental study, to music theory and analysis, and composition. They will discover music from around the world and examine the development of music across traditions and history. They will also develop craft, perspectives and dispositions of a musician, which will enrich their journey in any field beyond SOTA.  
  
**Creating and Performing Tracks**
