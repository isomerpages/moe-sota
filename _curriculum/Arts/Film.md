Students specialising in Film at Year 5 and 6 will explore film as a cinematic art form and track its development through history, theory, and production techniques. They will learn to balance theory and practice, and deconstruct film for meanings through its language and grammar. They will understand film as a cultural document for exploration of issues ranging from formal aesthetics to historical representation, from the regional film industries to transnational audience reception. They will also gain an understanding of the influence of the time and space in which a film is made.  
  
As film is teeming with artistic possibilities, students will acquire the technical and collaborative skills to create original work, which they will showcase.
