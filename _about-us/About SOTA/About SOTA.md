The School of the Arts (SOTA) is Singapore’s first national pre-tertiary specialised arts school with a six-year integrated arts and academic curriculum, leading to the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma or Career-related Programme, for youths aged 13-18 years old.  
  
Under the ambit of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), SOTA offers a dedicated development path for those who have interest and show early talent in the arts, providing a learning environment where both the artistic and academic potential can best be realised.  
  
With a vision to nurture creative citizens for the future, SOTA aims to identify and groom artistic and creative learners who positively impact Singapore and the world, through a vibrant learning environment that is anchored in the arts.  
  
A school of the future, SOTA embraces a holistic educational philosophy that celebrates experimentation, expression and discovery.

### Teaching Philosophy

Our teaching approach is future-oriented with a&nbsp;[curriculum](/curriculum)&nbsp;that engages students both academically and artistically. By providing a conducive environment that celebrates experimentation, expression and discovery, we seek to:

*   Value every student and nurture their all-round development and well-being
*   Create learner-centred classrooms environments
*   Develop formative and summative assessments aligned with the different points in a student’s learning cycle
*   Deliver practice that is well-grounded in theory

### Academic Calendar

SOTA's academic calendar broadly follows the Ministry of Education schools' academic calendar with some variations to accommodate the International Baccalaureate programmes.

### Our Teachers

Our academic teachers are trained educators with several years of teaching experience. Many of our arts teachers are practising artists who will offer students insights into the creative inspirations and perspectives of real-life arts practitioners.

### The SOTA Logo

<img style="width:75%" src="/images/sota-logo-white.jpg">

The SOTA identity is a blank stencil that is only completed when there is input. The identity is therefore always different and fresh with the only constant being the SOTA outline. It supports the school's mission to celebrate experimentation, expression and creativity, with strong engagement and space for personal design.
