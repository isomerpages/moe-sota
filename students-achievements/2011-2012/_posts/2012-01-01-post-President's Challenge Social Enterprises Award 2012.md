SOTA's Year 3 Visual Arts student, Audrey Lee, did the school proud when her design was selected and commissioned to be produced into trophies for the President's Challenge Social Enterprises Award 2012 (PCSEA). The award ceremony took place at the Istana on 6 December 2012.

Inspired by pearls, Audrey's design represents different people from various communities. From the base to the top of the trophy, every single pearl plays an essential role to show how various people of our society come together to help and complement each other.

Launched in March 2012, the PCSEA is the only award within the social enterprise sector in Singapore that aims to recognise outstanding social enterprises for their contributions made to the social services sector.
