Year 4 Visual Arts student Kyra Poh has made Singapore and SOTA proud again!

Despite fracturing her rib in June, Kyra overcame the injury to win the solo freestyle title and topped the dynamic two-way category with her partner Choo Yi Xuan from Singapore Sports School. Read about this on The Straits Times&nbsp;[HERE](http://str.sg/oei5)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[HERE](http://str.sg/oe3M).
