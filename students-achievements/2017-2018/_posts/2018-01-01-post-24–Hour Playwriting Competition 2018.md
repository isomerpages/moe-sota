Congratulations to Year 4 Theatre students Ariadna Padron Yassin and Tiffany Ho who won 2nd and 3rd place in the Youth Category of the TheatreWorks' 24-Hour Playwriting Competition! The 21st&nbsp;edition of the competition in July this year challenged participants to use the venue of the competition as the foundation for their plays. Held at Haw Par Villa, participants immersed themselves in the Asian cultural park, filled with ancient Chinese mythology, folklore and history.
