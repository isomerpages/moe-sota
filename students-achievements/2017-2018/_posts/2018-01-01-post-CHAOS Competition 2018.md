Some of our Year 2 students were caught up in the whirlwind of excitement at the Creative and Heuristic Applications of Science (CHAOS) competition finals in May!  
  
In the multi-disciplinary Science competition this year, students had about four weeks from February to March to research and work on problems related to cyclones. At the finals and award ceremony on 23 May 2018, one of the two SOTA teams - consisting of Subashri Yuvaraj, Hasel Soh, Charlene Yong, and Larissa Yong - received Honorary Mention.  
  
Well done to all the students who represented SOTA and thank you Mr Alex Teng and Ms Angela Wong for your guidance!
