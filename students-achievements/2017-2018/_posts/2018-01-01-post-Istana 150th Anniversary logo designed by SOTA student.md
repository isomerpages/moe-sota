Year 5 Visual Arts student Charlie Chua's logo design for the Istana 150th&nbsp;anniversary celebrations stood out and was selected from over 100 entries submitted through the Istana 150 Logo Competition. He was invited to unveil the logo with President Halimah Yacob at the Istana during the Deepavali Istana Open House on 6 November 2018.&nbsp;  
  
The logo design, which will be featured on Istana 150 memorabilia, shows a white outline of the building against a strong red background.&nbsp;According to Charlie, his logo design was inspired by his visit to the Istana grounds when he was three years old. He recalled playing in the garden and seeing the building's facade in the morning sun.  
  
We are excited to see how his logo will feature on Istana's memorabilia!
