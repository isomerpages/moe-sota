We are proud to see Victoria Chen (Theatre, 2012) helming a new production under Wild Rice’s Directors’ Residency Programme! Titled “BULL”, the sold-out production on 7 - 9 Jan 2021 features our Theatre alumni Selma Alkaff (2014) and Brian Nai (2017) as well. Victoria was one of four directors selected from Wild Rice's open call in April, which garnered more than 60 submissions. Over six months, Victoria had the opportunity to hone her craft in collaboration with Mr Ivan Heng, Founding Artistic Director of Wild Rice, to bring her creative visions to life. This residency programme for directors marks a new initiative for the Wild Rice, which has long offered training opportunities for actors.

  

Each director was given the opportunity to choose and develop their script, cast and rehearse with their actors, assemble and lead a design team and more. “Under Ivan’s mentorship, I am stretched in all the right ways so as to make me confident enough to take control of my creative ideas and commit to them wholeheartedly,” Victoria shared.
