Class of 2012 Visual Arts alumna Daisy Toh's latest series, 'To Return From Sojourn' is exhibited as part of this year's ION Young Talent Programme! The series explores her experiences growing up in both Taiwan and Singapore, with details that reflect her growth during the formative years. “The works in the exhibition focus on different elements: like colours, depth, and perspectives," Daisy explains. “I’m inspired by landscapes and the environment I’m in. This series is about sunsets and the sky.” Read the full feature on Time Out Singapore [HERE](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/news/artist-spotlight-daisy-tohs-creations-are-inspired-by-natures-hues-110920).

  

'To Return From Sojourn' was displayed at ION Art, Level 4, from 6 - 22 Nov 2020. Congratulations, Daisy!
