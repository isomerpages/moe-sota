Local Malay newspaper Berita Harian featured SOTA alumnae siblings Safiah Noorhimli (Visual Arts, 2016), Maryam Noorhimli (Theatre, 2018) and Sarah Noorhimli (Visual Arts, 2019) with their supportive parents in November. As parents, Mr Noorhimli Ali and Ms Faridah Ahmad believe in giving their children space to explore and pursue their interests. Following their interests in the arts, Safiah, Maryam and Sarah enjoyed six years at SOTA and are now blazing their own paths in Architecture, Acting and Community Theatre, and Fine Arts respectively. As Ms Faridah says, "By taking the SOTA route, they can form their own route based on their dreams, not just according to the existing mould."

We also congratulate Sarah on receiving the Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (LBKM) scholarship earlier in September! She was presented the iconic Zubir Said Scholarship - Arts award in a virtual ceremony with Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs, as the Guest-of-Honour. Sarah continues to pursue her passion for the arts in the Fine Arts course at LASALLE.
