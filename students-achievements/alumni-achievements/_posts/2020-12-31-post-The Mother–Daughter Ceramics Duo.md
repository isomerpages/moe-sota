A key trait of our SOTA community is a strong collaborative spirit to make art and create something new. Visual Arts alumni Lee Lip Jiang (2013), Darryl Tan (2015), and Rebecca Chong (2017) have reunited as Architecture students at NUS, and the trio has joined their creative energies to launch the exhibition,&nbsp;_ArchiVal_. A compound between ‘archive’ and ‘carnival’,&nbsp;_ArchiVal_&nbsp;combines the two ideas of an ever-growing repository and a celebration of works by students from NUS Department of Architecture. Through this exhibition, visitors could find out more about the creative processes and rigour behind the works. Apart from Visual Arts alumni, Trevor Poh (Film, 2015) was part of the collaboration, where he captured the hard work that went into preparing for the exhibition in a wonderful behind-the-scenes video.

  

Held from 5 - 23 Dec 2020 at NUS School of Design and Environment,&nbsp;_ArchiVal_&nbsp;also featured works by Lip Jiang, Darryl, Rebecca, Ng Xin Yi (Visual Arts, 2018) and Clarabelle Pun (Visual Arts, 2018). Well done to our alumni!
