A fragile piece of paper could produce powerful art pieces - just take a look at the works by our Visual Arts faculty member Mr Jason Lim and alumna Tan Shao Qi (2018) in Gajah Gallery's exhibition,Â [Playing with Paper: Intimacies & Possibilities](https://gajahgallery.com/exhibition/playing-with-paper-intimacies-and-possibilities/)! Featuring 10 established and emerging artists, the online showcase explored how the participating artists portray profound intimacies and vast possibilities on paper. Mr Jason Lim presented two works on paper drawn from his iconic 'Under the Shadow of the Banyan Tree' series while Shao Qi transformed her signature paper-cut pieces into exquisite porcelain pieces.
