The Year 1 and Year 2 students had the opportunity to spend time with their families in school on 11 April 2019 at the FamChamps Honour Night!

Organised by the SOTA FamChamps, Honour Night is a student-initiated project, which aims to strengthen bonding for parents/guardians and their child/ward.

It was a wonderful evening filled with smiles, laughter, and love as the families bonded over performances and other activities!

On 6 July 2019, we celebrated the School receiving the Sustained Impact Award (Organisation) at the FamChamps Awards 2019! The award was presented by guest-of-honour Mr Sam Tan (Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Ministry of Social and Family Development). This is an inaugural award that recognises organisations for their unwavering commitment towards promoting and protecting the strong families in Singapore.   
  
SOTA was recognised for:  
\- Successive years of participation in FamChamps (since 2016)  
\- Broadening the scope of family-friendly initiatives in SOTA  
\- Inculcating a culture of promoting the vale of Family by integrating family-friendly initiatives into SOTA's structure and activities

We are also pleased to share that two of our FamChamps, Alexis Lim and Larissa Yong (both Year 3s), received the Outstanding FamChamps Awards! They are among the 10 recipients who have displayed strong qualities of being a Family Champion.   
  
_"FamChamps opened doors for me to be closer with my friends and to talk about our families. I used to feel that my parents are responsible for the family, but I came to realise that I also have a part to play in keeping my family together." - Alexis Lim, Year 3_  
  
A partnership with Focus on the Family, the FamChamps is a values-driven initiative to promote the holistic message of family and raise future family champions.
