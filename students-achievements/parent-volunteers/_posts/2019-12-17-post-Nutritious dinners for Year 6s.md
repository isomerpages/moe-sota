Staying healthy and eating well is key to staying focused during exams. Knowing that our Year 6s put in a lot of time to prepare for their IB exams, the SOTA Parent Support Group volunteered to prepare nutritious dinners for the students. The presence and support of the parent volunteers is a great encouragement to the students!
