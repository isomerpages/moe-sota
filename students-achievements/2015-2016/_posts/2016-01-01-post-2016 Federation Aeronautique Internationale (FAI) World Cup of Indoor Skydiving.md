Congratulations to our Year 2 Visual Arts student, Kyra Poh, on clinching the gold in the&nbsp;2016 Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) World Cup of Indoor Skydiving Junior Freestyle Category, held in Warsaw, Poland on 15 October 2016!&nbsp;  
  
Kyra suffered an early setback at the beginning of her final routine as her shoe fell off, making it slippery and difficult to perform one of her moves. However, she persevered and successfully completed her routine, and ultimately took home the gold.  
  
Together with her teammate Choo Yi Xuan, Kyra also placed fourth in the Dynamic 2-way Open Category. While the duo could have taken part in the Junior Category as they are both under 17 years of age, they had to compete in the Open Category against 22 other adult teams from 17 countries as there were insufficient teams for the Junior Category. The pair did extremely well to emerge in the fourth placing.  
  
In her interview with The Straits Times, Kyra said,&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it's not about the win that matters. It was mostly to expose the sport of indoor skydiving to Singapore. After my performance in Poland, hopefully this sport will be more well known in Singapore and I'm also rooting for it to be an Olympic sport one day, so I can represent the nation on a larger stage."  
  
Congratulations on your achievements, Kyra, we're so proud of you!
