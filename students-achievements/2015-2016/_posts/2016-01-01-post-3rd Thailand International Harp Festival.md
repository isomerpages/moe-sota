Hosted in Bangkok from 5-11 August, the competition was held in two stages. Bianca emerged as the final six after the first stage, and eventually came in third overall.

This is Bianca’s second international competition, and the first time she has won an award internationally. She was introduced to this competition by her Instrumental Studies teacher and performed five pieces at the competition.
