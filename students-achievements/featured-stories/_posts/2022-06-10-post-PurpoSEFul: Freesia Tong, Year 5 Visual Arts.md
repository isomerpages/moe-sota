The SOTA Endowment Fund (SEF) was established to address the need for long-term sustainability in providing our students with bursaries, scholarships, and other financial assistance. A SOTA student spends on school necessities such as school fees, books, art form materials, transport, meals, and school uniforms. Through the years, many members of the SOTA community have participated in campaigns organised by the school or initiated their own fundraising projects. Regardless of its scale, these purposeful contributions towards the SEF play a significant role in nurturing cultural leaders of tomorrow.  
  
In this new&nbsp;#PurpoSEFul&nbsp;series, we showcase how the SOTA community supports each other, thank the individuals who have contributed to the SEF, and encourage others to step forward and make a contribution too. We kickstart the series by chatting with Year 5 Visual Arts student&nbsp;**Freesia Tong**, designer of the adorable artworks found on our&nbsp;[**fundraising page**](/getting-involved/donate)!

**_"Hi Freesia! Could you share about what motivated you to participate in this project and design the artworks?"_**  
  
Hello! I am really thankful to be given this meaningful opportunity to create artworks for the SOTA Endowment Fund website! The SEF is very important in ensuring that all SOTA students have access to a quality arts education, and I've definitely been positively impacted by it too, given the holistic education that I've been exposed to.

In 2020, I participated in the fundraising concert “Sunburst” and performed with two of my friends, and collaborated with some Muscular Dystrophy Association Singapore (MDAS) members to produce artworks that were auctioned. This entire experience was one that I hold close to my heart until today, and it made me realise how blessed I was to be able to give back to the community. I also became more aware of what the SOTA Endowment Fund is and how it can change the lives of students who have a passion for the arts. Thus, when I learned about this project, I was really excited to apply my skills in digital design and translate them into meaningful artworks.

I strived for an “imaginative” illustration style to represent the hopes and aspirations that are fulfilled because of the SEF. I designed icons that depicted 'food', 'transport', and 'art and academic materials', which represent the different areas that the fund assists students with, and one that represents the sense of community in SOTA, all while including elements that are unique to SOTA culture. I also used a bright, warm colour palette to evoke a sense of fulfilment and happiness. I have a tendency to use lots of texture in my illustrations, so that's what I did for the designs too!

For the 'food' icon, I depicted a bowl of fishball noodles from SOTA's canteen. I remember it being the very first meal I had as a Year 1 student in SOTA, so it was an iconic food choice for me. The second design includes an illustration of the MRT, which is the mode of public transport many students take to school every day. You can also spot the sign “Dhoby Ghaut”, which is where our school is located at! The other designs encompass numerous art and academic materials, like books, resources, and uniforms, which the SEF helps to fund. The graduation cap in one of the designs also represents a sense of accomplishment and confidence after we have achieved our goals. It also represents how a holistic arts education nurtures students to become leaders.

The final design is especially special - it represents a sense of togetherness and inclusivity in SOTA. There are symbols like the paintbrush, pointe shoes, and music staves (just to name a few), which represent the different artforms we have here in SOTA: Visual Arts, Dance, Literary Arts, Music, Theatre and Film. Four SOTA students are featured together in this dreamlike space, while the word “SOTA” is painted across in bright orange, bringing all the elements together.
