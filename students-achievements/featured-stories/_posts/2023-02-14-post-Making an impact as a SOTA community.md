In November of last year, SOTA held its first fundraising show, Impact 2022.Â 

Despite it being the school holidays, the campus was buzzing with activities as students, alumni, teachers and staff prepared for the show.

At an open outdoor space in-between painting studios and science labs on Level 10, two long pieces of cloth hung down from the rooftop, soaking up ink from two containers. It was part of a performance art piece created and conceptualised by three Visual Arts students in collaboration with their peers from dance, music, and film.

Along the open corridor of the same level, a group of Theatre students were painting the large set pieces.

There were also alumni who came back and contributed to the show through performing, choreographing, filming, editing, and designing.
