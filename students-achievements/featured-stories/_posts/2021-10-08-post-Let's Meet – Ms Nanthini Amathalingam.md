In SOTA, students take the English Language and Critical Thinking from Year 1 to 4 and the Theory of Knowledge from Year 5 to 6. Through English Language and Critical Thinking (ELCT) lessons, students will learn to analyse a variety of real-world issues, discuss multiple perspectives on them, and learn to communicate their views effectively through various platforms. We speak to Ms Nanthini to find out more about ELCT and her teaching experience in SOTA.

  

**_Share about yourself and your work in SOTA._**

My students know me as Ms Nan and I have been teaching English Language and Critical Thinking (ELCT) to students from Year 1 through to Year 4 since July 2018. I am also&nbsp;supervisor to the Floorball CAS students.

  
  

**_What do you enjoy most about teaching in SOTA?_**

The most wonderful aspect of teaching in SOTA is interacting with vibrant students as well as colleagues. It is always amazing to witness the immense talent that the students possess in the arts through the various showcases. SOTA students are empathetic and very sensitive towards a variety of global issues. The discussions that we have in the classroom are often so rich and diverse that I find myself learning as much from the students as they do from me. In addition, I have the utmost respect for my colleagues who motivate and inspire me to constantly better myself as a teacher. The passion that teachers in SOTA possess is incredibly infectious.

**_How do you make your classes engaging for your students?_**

I am a firm believer that everyone learns better when they are having fun. I enjoy telling stories and injecting humour into my lessons so that the students laugh as they learn. A crucial aspect of the subject is understanding multiple perspectives thus I focus on creating an environment in which students are comfortable and confident in sharing their thoughts and opinions while being respectful. We explore a range of topics in the classroom which makes ELCT relevant to the students. The students are able to incorporate a wide variety of knowledge from their everyday lives to the lessons which allows them to add value to the content that is covered in a lesson. This increases their confidence in themselves and motivates them to expand on their existing knowledge of the world.

**_What gives you the greatest satisfaction in your work?_**

The greatest satisfaction that I could gain from my work is knowing that my students enjoy what they learn in the classroom and apply that knowledge to the real world. My greatest sense of pride comes from witnessing my students’ growth through the years.

  

**_We heard that you’re a floorball enthusiast and an avid runner. Tell us more about your experiences._**

When I was asked to be the supervisor for the Floorball CAS In SOTA, I was incredibly excited because I absolutely love the sport. The high intensity of the sport has always been my favourite aspect of the game as there is never a dull moment. I personally feel that team sports play a crucial role in character building because I remember learning some of the most important life lessons during the years when I was part of a floorball team for both my school and an external club. I do also enjoy going for long runs because it helps me clear my head. After a long day, running really helps me to relax, organise my thoughts and reflect on what needs to be done.

  
  

**_What would you say to primary school students (or their parents) who may be interested to come to SOTA?_**

SOTA is not just an educational institution, but an experience. The journey that SOTA has to offer will craft you/your child into a more confident and resilient individual.
