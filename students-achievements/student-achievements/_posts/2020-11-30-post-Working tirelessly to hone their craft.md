Congratulations to our Dance students on a good showing at the International Ballet Grand Prix Singapore 2020! Year 5 student Kynda Ng placed second in the Senior 1 Ballet category, while Year 3 students Angeline Veronica Koh and Andrea Mae Y Fernandez placed first and second respectively in the Youth 2 Ballet category. In addition to their placement, Kynda was offered a two-week tuition scholarship at The Australian Ballet School, and Andrea was awarded a place in the Singapore Dance Theatre's Scholar's Programme.

  

In the process of preparing for the competition, the students worked tirelessly with their mentors Mr Ng Teck Voon and Ms Cheah Mei Sing to discover better versions of themselves. We are proud of our dancers and we hope this opportunity inspires them to press on in their pursuit of the art form!
