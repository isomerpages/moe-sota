Dance students Teo Jun Ning (Year 5), Han Xin Yi (Year 5), and Timothy Ching (Year 3) participated in the Asian Grand Prix International Ballet Competition in Hong Kong from 8-13 August 2016.  
  
Though they did not make it into the finals, the trio performed beautifully on their individual stages. Faculty member and mentor Jacinta Walsh travelled with the students and their proud parents who took time off to fly to Hong Kong to support them.  
  
The three dance students also attended classes at The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.
