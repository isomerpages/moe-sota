Year 6 IBCP Visual Arts student Tan Shao Qi's work was featured at Gajah Gallery's exhibition, The New Now II: VIVID AND VEILED. Titled&nbsp;_Hidden Wilderness_, the artwork was inspired by Shao Qi's memory of discovering the quiet splendour of nature along a secluded area in Tanjong Rhu road. Remaining vivid and arresting in her memory since, the grandeur of a mature rain tree is revealed in her photographic work. Rendered in black and white, and focusing on the subtleties of shadows and textures instead of the vibrancy of colour, the image exudes a melancholic mood. This moves viewers to ponder the artist's process of recollection.
