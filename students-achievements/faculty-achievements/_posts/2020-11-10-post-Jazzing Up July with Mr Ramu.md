Adjusting to the ‘new normal’ is a phrase that many of us have heard especially since coming out of the Circuit Breaker. As we navigate and try to make sense of this new world, artists are also figuring out how to continue inspiring and creating with their craft.

It was just after the Circuit Breaker that Mr Ramu Thiruyanam had his first music performance for “Jazz in July”, an annual event organised by the Esplanade. While playing music was second nature to him, the rest of the evening was filled with many firsts.  
  

It was the first time the Esplanade presented live performances since closing in April. The performances were livestreamed for the first time. It was Mr Ramu’s first duet performance. There were no audiences.

Because of the nature of the set up and safe distancing measures, only 10 people were allowed to be at the venue and 8 of them were made up by crew.

Mr Ramu shared that although it was awkward without the applause after each performance, the experience challenged him to step out of the normal and figure out how to not only perform but also how to interact with the people who were tuning in online. He enjoyed being able to communicate with friends and fans on social media and receive direct feedback or encouragement from them.

We look forward to the many more music performances Mr Ramu has in store. Thank you for continuing to share your craft with the world even through these changing times!
