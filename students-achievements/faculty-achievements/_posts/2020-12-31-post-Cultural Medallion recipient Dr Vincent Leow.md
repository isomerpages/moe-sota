Heartiest congratulations to our Visual Arts faculty member Dr Vincent Leow on receiving the Cultural Medallion! Regarded as the highest arts honour in Singapore, the Cultural Medallion recognises individuals whose artistic excellence as well as contribution and commitment to the arts have enriched and distinguished Singapore’s arts and cultural landscape.

  

Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, congratulated Dr Leow on his&nbsp;[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/edwintongSC/photos/pcb.3507700755982678/3507699819316105/), "Dr. Vincent Leow, one of our Cultural Medallion recipients, is a visual artist known for his use of mixed media to interrogate the role of the artist and art-making in contemporary society, interspersed with his own personal observations and experiences.  
  
I am particularly impressed by the range of mediums and genres Vincent works with – including sculpture, painting, printmaking, drawing, video and more."

  

Congratulations to Dr Leow once again and thank you for inspiring so many of us at SOTA!
