In spite of all that has happened this year, the SOTA FamChamps continue to advocate strong, resilient families. 11 Year 3 students successfully completed a six-month experiential journey, which included a camp in October 2019, a school-based family service project and other Family Challenge activities.

  

Our FamChamps overcame the limits of the pandemic by executing the school-based project virtually. By designing a Family Month Package, the FamChamps reached out to their peers and encouraged them to build strong family bonds through home-based activities during the Circuit Breaker. It was an uphill task but they completed the project successfully. Through this project, the SOTA FamChamps built resilience in families and in themselves too.

  

To celebrate their efforts, a collar pin and certificate were presented to each FamChamp in class in August and a digital awards ceremony was held in September for FamChamps from all over Singapore. We are proud to share that Year 3 students Celine Shen and Emma Grace Sung received the Outstanding FamChamp Award for displaying responsibility, leadership and passion during their FamChamps journey. Well done to all FamChamps and special thanks to Mr Sim Kang Chong for guiding the SOTA team throughout the project! Watch the FamChamps Awards video&nbsp;[HERE](https://youtu.be/paS4_NENv6I).
