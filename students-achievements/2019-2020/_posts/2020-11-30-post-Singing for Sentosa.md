2020 has been difficult for many of us, from working and studying at home to taking care of our physical and mental well-being. Sentosa reminds us to make time for a holiday and rediscover the island in their latest video, "My Island Adventure". Did you know that the song in the video was sung and led by our Year 1 Music student Sue-Ann Ho? Her sweet, cheerful voice accompanies the adorable video to lift our spirits and put us in a holiday mood! Well done, Sue-Ann!
