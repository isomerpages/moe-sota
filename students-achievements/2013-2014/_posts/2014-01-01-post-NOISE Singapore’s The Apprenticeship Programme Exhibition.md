Works by Visual Arts IBCC students Ryan Benjamin Lee and Nur Aqilah Binte Hassan, Darryl Tan Shaole (Year 5), Lai Yu Tong (Year 6) and alumna Lu Kejia are featured at the NOISE Singapore’s The Apprenticeship Programme Exhibition, running from 16 August to 7 September 2014.

Our teaching faculty members Grace Tan, Robert Zhao, Liao Jiekai and Ng Shi Wen were also involved in this programme.

The Apprenticeship Programme (TAP) is a visual arts mentorship programme organised by NOISE Singapore. This year, 22 established practitioners in the fields of art, design, moving images and photography guided 51 apprentices over a period of four months. The programme culminates in a group exhibition showcasing original works created by the apprentices.
