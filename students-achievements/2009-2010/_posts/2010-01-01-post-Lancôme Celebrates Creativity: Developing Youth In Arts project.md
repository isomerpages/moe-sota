Visual arts students worked in teams to create one-minute flash format videos that clearly articulated the key embodiments of the Lancôme brand in Lancôme Celebrates Creativity: Developing Youth In Arts project, with one winning entry from each thematic category receiving a fully sponsored academic year worth of tuition fees, approximately S$5,000. Emerging tops are Jade Chan Su Hui and Janel Ang Jia En with _Believe in Beauty_; Bevin Ng Jie Wei and Mariel Chee Wei Lin with _Innocence_; and Kirti Upadhyaya and Valerie Ng Suying with _Amalgamation_.
