Class of 2017 Visual Arts alumni Lim Zeharn and Lim Zeherng - who refer to themselves as "ZZ" - contributed to the most recent iteration of&nbsp;_Singapore Calendar_&nbsp;by designing the graphics of a Hungry Ghosts’ Festival-themed calendar.&nbsp;_Singapore Calendar_&nbsp;is a newly-launched seasonal programme held over four months, organised by local arts organisation OH! Open House. For each iteration of the programme, an artist develops works inspired by a significant date or time period.  
  
ZZ was recently featured in local Chinese newspaper Lianhe Zaobao (联合早报), together with the artist of the current iteration, Mr Eugene Tan. The brothers shared about themselves and their works in the article, which is found&nbsp;[here](https://bit.ly/2zGiuP2). A translation of the article is found in the comments section of this&nbsp;[Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/SOTA.SG/photos/a.176685832498218/1134882420011883).
