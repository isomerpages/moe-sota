### Over 90% of IBCP students achieve excellence in IB results

The 2017 SOTA cohort collected their IB results on 5 January 2018. SOTA’s IBCP students did exceptionally well this year, with over 90% of the cohort achieving excellence in their examinations comprising Career-related Studies and at least two diploma subjects. This marks the best performance by IBCP students since SOTA pioneered the programme in 2014. A total of 131 students sat for the IBDP examinations and achieved a 100% pass rate. Over 80% of them scored 35 points and above.
