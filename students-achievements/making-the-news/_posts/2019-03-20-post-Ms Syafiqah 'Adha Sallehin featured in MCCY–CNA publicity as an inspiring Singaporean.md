Our Music adjunct faculty member Syafiqah ‘Adha Sallehin was recently featured on Channel NewsAsia (CNA).

  

The Ministry of Community, Culture and Youth (MCCY) worked with CNA to develop an online series called&nbsp;_Where The Heart Is_&nbsp;to put the spotlight on Singaporeans who impact other Singaporeans, and Ms Syafiqah was one of the profiles. A composer and co-founder of The Open Score Project, a young ensemble venturing into a musical 'no-man’s land' in Singapore, Ms Syafiqah was the first Malay-Muslim Singaporean graduate of the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music at the National University of Singapore.
