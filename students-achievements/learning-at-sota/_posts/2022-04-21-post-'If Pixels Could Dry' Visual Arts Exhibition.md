In 2020, Year 4 Visual Arts students learnt to utilise programming language as part of their Visual Arts repertoire, combining software and design to develop innovative artworks. As a culmination of their learning experience, they organised the online showcase "If Pixels Could Dry" that featured artworks designed using the p5.js software. The artworks revolved around themes of identity and culture.  
   
“If Pixels Could Dry” was originally planned for a physical exhibition, but unforeseen circumstances and COVID-19 safety measures posed new challenges that the students had to adapt to and overcome quickly. They embraced the opportunity to confront an unfamiliar domain as part of their learning journey and present their artworks through an online showcase.  
   
The students displayed outstanding determination and creativity, and we are glad to see their efforts pay off with this unique Visual Arts exhibition.
