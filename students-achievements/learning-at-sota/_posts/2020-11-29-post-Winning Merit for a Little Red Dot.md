The results of the 6th edition of the National Schools Xinyao Singing and Songwriting Competition "新空下 \[Xin Kong Xia\]" were announced on 23 November 2020. We are proud to share that Year 6 Music student Rachel Sim received the Merit award in the Songwriting (Open) category! Her piece, 小红点 (Little Red Dot), is about Singaporeans' daily life and highlights the uniqueness of the Singaporean lifestyle (such as a love for eating). Though we are a small country with big dreams, which may cause us to feel stressed at times, we are happy living in this little red dot because we are right at home with our loved ones. Through this work, Rachel hopes to emphasise on the Singaporean identity with song lyrics that are relatable and full of local flavours.

  

What a remarkable first attempt at writing a song in Mandarin! Congratulations, Rachel! We also thank Mr Allan Ho from our Mother Tongue Language faculty for guiding Rachel in this competition. "Little Red Dot" has been performed and recorded by Rachel and her fellow Year 6 Music cohort mate Ewan MacRae. The song is slated to be released in a compilation album next year. We can't wait to hear it!
