Here at SOTA, we embrace a holistic educational philosophy and provide a learner-centred environment. The unique SOTA education model is more than the sum of its parts.  
  
Our integrated academic and arts programme combines academic rigour and artistic development with active citizenry to develop students who dream big, pursue their passions, think independently and lead with compassion. Our vision is to realise both the artistic and academic potential of future generations of artists and creative professionals.  
  
We are an International Baccalaureate (IB) World school that is accredited to offer the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP) and the IB Career-related Programme (IBCP). Parallel to this, our specialised arts and integrated arts programmes develop the artistic dispositions of students, and heightens their creative awareness. In addition, our holistic student development programmes nurture students who will eventually influence and contribute to the community through their creativity and talents.
