SOTA offers a specialised arts curriculum in Years 5 and 6 under the IB Career-related Programme (IBCP). IBCP students engage with a challenging programme of study that imparts transferable and lifelong skills in applied knowledge, critical thinking, communication, and cross-cultural engagement.  
  
SOTA's IBCP programme enables students to undergo deeper training in the arts in order to prepare for artistic and/or arts-related careers as well as gain admission into undergraduate and professional programmes at art institutions and conservatories.

**The IBCP enables students to:**

*   Develop a broad range of career-related competencies and to deepen their understanding in general areas of knowledge;
*   Prepare for effective participation in an ever-changing world of work;
*   Foster the attributes of the learner profile, allowing students to become true lifelong learners willing to consider new perspectives;
*   Engage in learning that makes a positive difference to future lives; and
*   Become a self-confident person ready for life in the 21st century.

  
In Years 5 and 6, our IBCP students are required to offer the&nbsp;**four IBCP core subjects**&nbsp;(Reflective Project, Personal and Professional Skills, Language Development, and Service Learning),&nbsp;**three modules of Career-related Studies**, and&nbsp;**two Diploma Subjects**&nbsp;of which one must be Arts at Higher Level and the other a Language B or Language ab initio subject at Standard Level.  
  
Students may take an optional third Diploma subject (Economics, Geography, History, or Social and Cultural Anthropology).
