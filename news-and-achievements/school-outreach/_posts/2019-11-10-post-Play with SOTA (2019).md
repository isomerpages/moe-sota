_Play with SOTA_Â is one of SOTA's music outreach programmes supported by Temasek Foundation. In November 2019, the music faculty invited Primary 4 and 5 pupils from more than 10 primary schools to SOTA for a series of masterclasses and workshops.

Whether the primary school participants played percussion, brass or Chinese instruments, our Music students from SOTA Percussion, Wind and Chinese Music Ensembles were there to patiently guide them. Applause and smiles filled the Orchestral Rehearsal Studio at the final showcase on 9 November 2019. We hope everyone enjoyed the music-making process and playing with SOTA!
