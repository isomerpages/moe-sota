The SOTA Primary 6 Creative Writing Competition 2019 was launched in end-2018, and closed on 8 February 2019. Results were released in early-March.  
  
This year, the Competition received an approximate 25% increase in entries - from 1,200 to a whopping 1,500! In view of this, 76 finalists were selected, instead of the initially-intended 50. The name list of the finalists can be foundÂ [here](https://www.sota.edu.sg/p6cwcom2019).  
  
We would like to thank our sponsor, Singapore Press Holdings Foundation, for supporting us in reaching out to children who possess the passion and talent for writing.  
  
Stay tuned for updates on the upcoming Junior Academy, which our finalists will be involved in!
