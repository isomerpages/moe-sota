Earlier in April, the Top 3 winners of the third edition of the SOTA Primary 6 Creative Writing Competition were announced. These essays by these promising writers stood out from 1,500 submissions. Our heartiest congratulations to our young writers!

**First Place:** Alifah Ilyana Binte Mohammed Jawahir (Sembawang Primary School)  

**Second Place:** Lim En Qi (Keming Primary School) 

**Third Place:** Aisha Tang Binte Muhammed Taufiq Tang (CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace)  
  
The top 73 finalists got to participate in SOTA's Short Fiction Junior Academy workshop held on 30 March 2019, conducted by our Literary Arts teachers and Ms. Adeline Foo, author of _The Diary of Amos Lee_. They played Word Games, read stories about _The Mars Room_, _Magical Parakeets_ and _Crystal Balls_ written by Literary Arts teachers. They later also wrote a phantasmagorical story on the spot.  
  
Once again, we would like to thank our sponsor Singapore Press Holdings Foundation for supporting us in reaching out to children who possess the passion and talent for writing.
