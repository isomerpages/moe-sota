SOTA officially launched the Arts Development Award (ADA) during its annual Awards Day on 30 July 2018! Funded by Temasek Foundation Nurtures (TFN), the Award is offered to Primary 4 to 6 pupils from low-income families who show interest and artistic potential in dance or visual arts, to allow them to be exposed and enriched by an early arts education.&nbsp;  
  
Complementing the Award is the SOTA Buddy Programme. The Buddy Programme creates opportunities for ADA recipients to be supported by SOTA students in academic, artistic, and personal growth. Concurrently, the Programme provides opportunities for the character and leadership development of these SOTA students.  
  
A total of 23 primary school pupils received the Award this year and some of them shared how the award has benefitted them in this video.
