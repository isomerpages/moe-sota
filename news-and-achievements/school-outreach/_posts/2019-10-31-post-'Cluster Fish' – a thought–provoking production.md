_"We are all animals trying to survive in this jungle. Some move in packs - a swarm of bees, a flock of swans, a herd of cattle, and... a cluster of fish?"_  
  
Our Year 4 Theatre students staged a brilliant production in July with four runs of _Cluster Fish_, specially written for upper primary school children by prominent local playwright Haresh Sharma. Held at the SOTA Studio Theatre, the production ran from 23 to 25 July 2019, to audiences comprising of both primary school students and the general public.

Confronting the various pressures a primary school student faces, _Cluster Fish_ was a thought-provoking play. We were heartened by the level of engagement and enthusiasm during the post-show talk, where our primary school friends had the chance to speak with the cast and crew behind the production.
