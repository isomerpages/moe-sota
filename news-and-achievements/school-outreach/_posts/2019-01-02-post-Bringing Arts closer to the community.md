It is always fun to take our showcases outside SOTA’s halls. In September 2018, our Year 6 IBCP Theatre students journeyed through a frightening and magical forest with the help of some friends along the way!  
  
Held at The Artground, the interactive performance,&nbsp;_Which way? This way!_, was specially created for 7 – 10 year olds. There was a total of six shows over three afternoons from 20 to 22 September, and primary school students from 25 schools attended the showcases.

This is the second time SOTA is collaborating with The Artground to bring arts closer to the community, to create a fun and informal environment for primary school children to appreciate theatre and to learn to express themselves through it. Last year, SOTA presented an interactive performance of&nbsp;_Laszlo And The Dark_&nbsp;for primary school children at The Artground.&nbsp;

Do look out for more of our outreach showcases next year, and check out a little re-cap of&nbsp;_Percussio_,&nbsp;_Smartbutt_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_Which Way? This Way!&nbsp;below._
