This year, the SOTA Primary 6 Art Competition received 30% more submissions in comparison to last year's event. The submissions came from over 140 primary schools in Singapore!  
  
With the support from our sponsor, Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd, SOTA was able to continue to reach out to children with passion and talent in visual arts.  
  
The top 50 finalists were invited to participate in the Junior Academy (JA) workshop on 18 March 2019. Facilitated by the Visual Arts Faculty, the JA workshop was specially designed to introduce 2D and 3D art-making processes to pupils with artistic potential.

On 22 March 2019, an award ceremony was held for these top 50 finalists, which was followed by the official opening of the Winners' Exhibition. The participants excitedly took photos with their works, and viewed what their peers had created.

To provide a well-deserved additional showcase opportunity for the finalists, Mapletree organised a second exhibition at VivoCity from 8 to 19 April 2019. The opening of the exhibition was graced by Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education.  
  
Heartiest congratulations to all finalists, and thank you once again for your active participation!
