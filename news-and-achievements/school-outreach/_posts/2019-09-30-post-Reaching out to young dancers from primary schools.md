In September, the Year 5 IBCP Dance students had special guests at their IBCP Repertoire and Performance Dance showcase. More than 30 teachers and students from eight primary schools attended the showcase as part of SOTAâ€™s outreach efforts. After the showcase, Dance faculty member Ms Celine Tan facilitated a post-performance talk, where the audience could ask the performers questions about their repertoire and dance journey, or give feedback on the presentation.
