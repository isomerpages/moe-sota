How often does one have the opportunity to exhibit with their parents? For Visual Arts alumna Tan Shao Qi, this rare opportunity came when she and her mother exhibited their ceramics works in the&nbsp;_Tokoname Wood-Fired Ceramics Exhibition: Playing with Fire_. The exhibition featured works made and wood-fired in the traditional Anagama kiln in Tokoname, Japan. We caught up with Shao Qi and her mother, Ms Jaslin Poh, on their experience working together for an exhibition that took place during the pandemic.  
  

&nbsp;Congratulations on your successful showing at "Playing with Fire"! How did it feel to be preparing and exhibiting during such unprecedented times?

 **SQ:**&nbsp;Thank you! There were uncertainties concerning the setting up of the exhibition and worries about the safety measures. I was able to help out with the preparations of the show in person since I have been back home resuming my studies online. Prior to returning home, I have been assisting in the preparations of the show online as the designer.&nbsp; We had to adapt to the current situation and be flexible to change to be able to exhibit during such unprecedented times.  
  
**JP:**&nbsp;This pandemic has halted many plans and delayed the opening of the exhibition. I view this as a reminder for us to slow down, pause and reflect on what is most important to us in the midst of our hectic lives. It gave me more time to plan the curation of the show and discover new ways to promote the show digitally.

&nbsp;Was this the first time both of you exhibited works together? How was the experience working together?&nbsp;

**JP:**&nbsp;Yes it was, and it was very memorable. Our shared interest in ceramics has forged a closer bond between us over the past few years, and we’re glad that this exhibition allowed us to showcase our works together.  
  
**SQ:**&nbsp;Being able to work alongside and learn from my mother has shaped my perspective of the things around me and my art-making process. The support we have for each other, and the mutual appreciation we share for the arts is crucial in sustaining both our artistic practices.

&nbsp;Shao Qi, how has the COVID-19 situation disrupted your studies and how are you coping with the changes brought on by this?

 **SQ:**&nbsp;I have been back home resuming my studies online. Despite the time differences and inability to access my university’s facilities, I have been trying to cope and develop new works at home by making space for a mini makeshift studio at home. I also visit local pottery studios to utilise the available facilities while adjusting to my new schedule. This has brought about opportunities to work on local projects and exhibitions, which has helped me to connect with the local arts scene and link my art practice back home.
 
**The arts is often seen as a difficult career pathway to pursue. Share with us why you support your daughter's passion for visual arts?**

**JP:**&nbsp;My husband and I both studied art together, and we believe that art is crucial in stimulating the mind, which is why we are so supportive of our children’s career in the arts. An art career is challenging to pursue. Determination, motivation and self-discipline are pivotal in developing a practice in the arts. Working alongside my daughter and seeing how determined, meticulous and self-disciplined she is, I am confident that she will succeed in what she sets her mind to. I will always give her my full support, just like she does for me.

**Thank you for sharing about your experiences so candidly with us so far! One final question, what advice do both of you have for young, aspiring artists?**

**SQ:**&nbsp;We have to be flexible to change and identify ways to make the best out of the current situation. There are increased opportunities and accessibility to digital platforms, such as open calls for virtual exhibitions, live artist talks and online workshops. We should keep ourselves informed of these available resources and be involved in these opportunities.  
  
**JP:**&nbsp;As a teaching potter, I feel that it is essential to be immersed in the making process more than refining the end product. From learning the basics of hand-building, throwing and glazing, to the firing process, we can learn and improve a lot from our obstacles and mistakes. Maintain a positive mindset and embrace any challenges faced, and it will eventually allow you to bring out the best in your work. Do not let what others may say about pursuing a career in the arts sway you – trust your art-making process and yourself.
