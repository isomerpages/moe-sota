Our academic teachers are trained educators with several years of teaching experience. Like our students, many of them also have a strong passion for the arts. We speak with Mr Alex Teng from the Science faculty to find out more about his role as a science teacher and his passion for dance.

  

**_Share about yourself and your work in SOTA._**

I enjoy my roles at SOTA as a Coordinated Science teacher, Physics teacher, a teacher-in-charge of Service Learning (SL) and the student leadership body, Leadership Academy (LeAd). I have a strong passion for dance as well so I make an effort to stay active in this pursuit to continue to grow and hopefully inspire.

  
  

**_What do you enjoy about teaching in SOTA?_**

The unique profile of the staff and students at SOTA makes teaching and learning interesting. I’m encouraged by the creativity and the spirit of experimentation shown by my colleagues and students here. There are plenty of opportunities for students to learn and acquire skills to be better leaders, team players and individuals both in and out of their subject areas.

  
  

**_How do you make your classes interesting for your students?_**

By tapping on students’ interest and strength in the arts, learning can be made more engaging, meaningful and fun with deeper understanding too. I make a conscious effort in relating Science and Physics concepts to real-life applications in areas that are relevant to our students, especially in the various artforms whenever possible.

As a dancer, I understand the need to spend long hours in practising the same movements and routines for perfection. It can be very challenging to juggle between dance sessions and other commitments. Therefore, work ethics and knowing how to prioritise are very important, and this is something I try to develop in my students as well.

**_What gives you the greatest satisfaction in your work?_**

When a student develops deep passion for the subject, looks beyond assessment and simply shows joy in learning. I’m especially proud of my students when they learn from their mistakes and show genuine kindness and gratitude.

  
  

**_What would you say to primary school students (or their parents) who may be interested to come to SOTA?_**

SOTA offers academic rigour to individuals who appreciate the arts. It is also a journey of self-discovery through your artform which enables you to make a more informed choice about future endeavours. The school experience will be a challenging, unique and fulfilling one.
