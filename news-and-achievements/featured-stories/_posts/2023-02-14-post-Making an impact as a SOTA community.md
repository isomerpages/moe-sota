In November of last year, SOTA held its first fundraising show, Impact 2022.&nbsp;

Despite it being the school holidays, the campus was buzzing with activities as students, alumni, teachers and staff prepared for the show.

At an open outdoor space in-between painting studios and science labs on Level 10, two long pieces of cloth hung down from the rooftop, soaking up ink from two containers. It was part of a performance art piece created and conceptualised by three Visual Arts students in collaboration with their peers from dance, music, and film.

Along the open corridor of the same level, a group of Theatre students were painting the large set pieces.

Three levels below in the dance studio, cast and crew gathered for combined rehearsals. Supporting one another in perfecting their lines or moves in the lead up to the show.

There were also alumni who came back and contributed to the show through performing, choreographing, filming, editing, and designing.

Not forgetting the teachers who provided direction and guidance over months of preparations up till the final curtain call.

During the week of the show, many more students stepped forward to help in various ways such as assisting with production, costumes, photography, ushering and more.&nbsp;

Finally, Impact 2022 was made possible with the support of generous donors through corporate and individual donations, ticket sales, and online donations.&nbsp;

The inaugural show raised a total of $235,000 for the SOTA Endowment Fund.

Impact 2022 not only showcased what makes the SOTA education experience unique, but  
also reflected how the SOTA community came together to make an impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The school would like to thank everyone who contributed in one way or another towards Impact 2022 and we look forward to seeing you at Impact 2023!&nbsp;
