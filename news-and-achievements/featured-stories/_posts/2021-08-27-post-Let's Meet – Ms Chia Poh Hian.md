From a full-time dance artist to an arts educator now, SOTA Dance faculty member Ms Chia Poh Hian or more commonly known as Ms Poh by the students, enjoys sharing, exploring and creating alongside students. To Ms Poh, teaching, in some ways, helps her to effect the change she wants to see in the world. Read on to find out what teaching means to her and what gives her the greatest satisfaction in her work.

  

**_Share about yourself and your work in SOTA._**

I am Poh Hian, a member of the Dance Faculty. I have mainly been teaching the lower and middle year students contemporary dance, improvisation and integrated arts. In the process, I enjoy sharing, exploring and creating alongside students. As a full-time dance artist turned arts educator, I work to create safe spaces for young adults to discover and appreciate the world around them as they journey towards self-discovery.

  
  

**_What do you enjoy about teaching in SOTA?_**

Happy surprises. From chancing upon eureka moments to being challenged by my students and colleagues, I enjoy how teaching at SOTA allows for meaningful experiences and fresh perspectives.

  
  

**_How do you make your classes interesting for your students?_**

As a performer, I often liken teaching to a performance. From my body language to how I say what I say matters, especially when students are tired and they need your energy for support. Apart from guiding students to find relevance and real applications in their learning, I think having a sense of humour in the process of learning helps bring enjoyment to the mundane. Lastly, I believe I have to walk the talk to be curious myself. Being curious to seek out meaningful experiences, fresh perspectives to then self-reflect takes practice.

  
  

**_We know that you are also a SOTA alumna. What are some takeaways from your SOTA education and how does being an alumna influence your teaching and current work at SOTA?_**

I rarely declare to my students that I was once a student here actually (: But on the rare occasions that I do, I find myself reminding them of how special SOTA is. For not too long ago, there was no such school in Singapore that offered an education like this.  
  
The SOTA education seeded and challenged me to consider what it really was to be open-minded, adaptable and resilient. I was fortunate enough to have joined SOTA in its pioneering stages. SOTA was a bold statement, and it should continue to be so, for if not us, then who or where will we find a collective of creatives 'trained' to embrace differences and engage in meaningful discourse though artful mediums, and who understands what it means to be under-appreciated and ‘unessential’ yet continue in our beliefs and practice.  
  
No, SOTA is not exclusive to students who want to be professional artists, but rather, it is an education that nurtures more whole and empathetic beings. I think in some ways teaching helps me to effect the change I want to see in the world.

  
  

**_What gives you the greatest satisfaction in your work? When do you feel happiest/ proudest of your students?_**

When I see students happy. They range from small everyday acts of kindness, friendships and generosity to eventful milestones like braving a showcase, graduating and eventually making a difference.

  
  

**_What would you say to primary school students (or their parents) who may be interested to come to SOTA?_**

I am not going to lie. Life at SOTA can be demanding, but it is truly one of a kind. Honestly, it may not be for everyone, but if it excites you to engage with peers and teachers who share your interest in your artform, or that you simply enjoy learning creatively and critically, you should come and find out more.

  
  

**_How do you continue to pursue your artistic practice even with a busy schedule at school?_**

Keeping a practice alongside teaching is not easy, but yes! I am proud to say that I am still going. I guess the work I created for our Year 5 dance students last year is a project that I am still investigating.
