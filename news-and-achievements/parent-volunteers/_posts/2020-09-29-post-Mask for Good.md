After three months of laborious planning and three weeks of intensive sewing, the SOTA Parents successfully completed the Mask for Good project! An initiative by the SOTA Parent Support Group to raise funds for the SOTA Endowment Fund, the project involved 90 parent volunteers (including grandmas, mums and dads) to sew more than 2500 masks from scratch! The Parents generously gifted one handmade mask to each student and staff, and raised over $16,000 for the SOTA Endowment Fund through the sale of the rest.

  

The mask designs were selected from an open call where students were invited to submit designs. An overwhelming number of submissions were received and shortlisted designs were announced for the School to vote. The designs with the highest number of votes are by Chua Jia Xuan, Elva Sim, and Nadra Ahmad (in alphabetical order). Congratulations!

"The small items that represent our everyday lives are what builds our SOTA community- deadlines, the pigeons; in the canteen, the drinks keep us energetic; the SOTA sweatshirt; - these are the things by our side every single day in the midst of our journey. I therefore put all of these together to bring out the essence of our SOTA community."

"I chose to use the pigeons to represent the culture and spirit of SOTA because pigeons are commonly spotted around the school compound. Students love taking pictures of them or chasing after them. The one on the left is holding the SOTA flag high and proud, while the one on the right is wearing the SOTA sweater. The mask uses the same shade of red as the SOTA flag and SOTA sweater."

"We, as people, have strength and love. The colourful circles represent a lively, diverse community united by their friendship and bonds, while the star represents shared aspirations and efforts."

We appreciate the sore fingers, backaches and love behind every mask. Thank you SOTA Parents for embarking on this project for a good cause!
