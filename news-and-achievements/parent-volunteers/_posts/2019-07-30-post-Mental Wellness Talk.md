As part of their efforts to support other parents on the parenting journey, SOTA Parent Support Group organised a Mental Wellness talk for parents on 3 May 2019.

During the talk, parents gained insights into the emotional and cognitive landscape of youths today, and learnt about the common tell-tale signs and symptoms of mood swings. They were also taught the approaches and strategies they could use to support their children’s mental wellness.
