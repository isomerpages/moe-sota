2019 has been another purposeful year for the SOTA Parent Support Group (PSG). The PSG has been organising student- and parent-focused events, and promoting a strong sense of the SOTA community spirit.

  

To thank parent volunteers who have taken time to assist and support PSG events, an appreciation evening was held on Friday, 27 September 2019.

It was a fun-filled Bollywood-themed evening attended by SOTA Principal Mrs Mary Seah, staff, and parents. Many came in glamorous and colourful Indian ethnic costumes. The evening started with great conversations and networking over food. With the Bollywood music, some parents gamely did a fashion catwalk and also danced along with the music.

The gathering was filled with plenty of laughter and we made many memories that will be cherished. Needless to say, this was something parents would not mind working hard for!
