At this year's Teachers' Day celebrations, our talented students and teachers spared no effort in preparing a jaw-dropping concert programme. The line-up included a teachersâ€™ rock band, a special collaborative dance item by students and teachers, and a performance by SOTA's very own boy band. The SOTA community was also kept entertained by the engaging emcees, exciting trivia games, and the all-time favourite lucky draw. From the laughter and cheers, it was clear that both students and teachers had an enjoyable morning.

The ever-supportive SOTA Parents prepared a spread of delectable desserts to show their appreciation to the teachers. Take a look at the impressive dessert table!
