15 artworks by Year 4 Visual Arts students were showcased at the City Canvas, The URA Centre, in an exhibition titled&nbsp;_Time &amp; Space: Another Place, Another City_&nbsp;from 5 September - 9 October 2019. As part of their curriculum, the students considered the notion of a city based on the theme, "Time &amp; Space". Beyond the&nbsp;physical manifestations of buildings and landmarks, the students delved into the&nbsp;community spaces and the narratives as well. In their artworks, they proposed new models and insights to experience another place, another city through the lens of the intangible.

In addition to the opportunity to showcase&nbsp;works produced as part of their module in an external gallery, students were provided an all-round learning experience as they were involved in the consideration of the exhibition layout, exhibition set-up, and more. It was indeed a valuable learning opportunity!
