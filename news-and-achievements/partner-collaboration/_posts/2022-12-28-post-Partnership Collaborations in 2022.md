In 2022, SOTA students had various opportunities to present and perform their artistic works through the school’s collaboration with industry partners and institutions.  
  
**Jamming out at Singapore Night Festival 2022**  
  
In August, SOTA’s very own Pocket Pugs and Pop/Jazz band presented their take on hit songs from the 80s and 90s as well as recent chart toppers at the SOTA steps as part of Singapore Night Festival 2022. If you were part of the fantastic audience enjoying the memorable evening with our students, a huge thank you for the support!

**Envisioning The Singapore of Tomorrow with Singapore Tourism Board**  
  
Graduating International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme Visual Arts students Amber Lim, Andrew Huang, and Emma Tay created a mural that was featured in Singapore Tourism Board’s exclusive corporate hospitality suite for Singapore Grand Prix 2022. Their mural “The Singapore of Tomorrow” was inspired by our city’s unique local facets and how they fuse with nature. Their work envisions a future where sustainability is integrated with architecture and where every sunrise represents new beginnings.

**Collaboration with Lazada**  
  
As part of SOTA’s collaboration with Lazada, selected artworks of our Year 5 Visual Arts students — Emma Grace Sung, Erwin Chan Jie Jun, and Valencia Alexandra Ye Xuan — were set on display at Lazada’s regional headquarters and Singapore office (Lazada One) from October 2022 to April 2023. Emma, Erwin, and Valencia also had the opportunity to visit the Lazada One Visitor Centre and share more about their sculptures with Ms Josephine Seah (Senior Vice President, Head of Workplace Services) and Ms Lorraine Chua (Senior Vice President, Head of Organizational Culture).  
  
This partnership is part of Lazada’s outreach effort to support the arts, as well as to connect and engage with the learning institutes and youth in the arts and heritage precinct which Lazada One is located in. Our students were grateful for the opportunity and certainly enjoyed the quick office tour!

**Heritage Inspirations with Urban Redevelopment Authority**  
  
In collaboration with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), several Year 1 and 2 Visual Arts students created 30 ceramic tiles for the mural art exhibition — Heritage Inspirations. Each of the beautifully handcrafted tiles portrays the unique forms and patterns which are observed on heritage buildings in the city.  
  
The tiles were exhibited at the Singapore City Gallery (City Canvas) at the URA Centre, along with a video presentation of the students' creative process as they learn about the heritage and conservation of these buildings. The students and their family members were also invited for an opening reception at the gallery hosted by the URA.  
  
The Heritage Inspirations exhibition will run from 28 October 2022 to 30 January 2023.
