We were delighted to be part of The National Kidney Foundation's (NKF) 50-year journey celebrations. Our students had the opportunity to use their artistic talents to contribute portraits for a meaningful commemorative book. Featuring stories and reflections written by patients, caregivers, NKF staff and other stakeholders, the book was launched at NKF's 50 Years Together event by Guest-of-Honour, Speaker of Parliament, Mr Tan Chuan Jin.

Special thanks to SOTA Visual Arts teacher, Mr Zainuidin Samsuri for his guidance throughout this project and to NKF for allowing us to be a part of this journey!
