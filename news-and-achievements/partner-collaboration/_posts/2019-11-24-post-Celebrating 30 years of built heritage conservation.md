In collaboration with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), some of our Visual Arts students had the opportunity to display their works as part of the 30th anniversary of the URA Conservation Programme. Inspired by more than 7200 buildings and structures conserved in Singapore, our young artists provided a fresh perspective on 30 years of built heritage conservation through their illustrative artworks. Under the guidance of Visual Arts faculty member Mr Yeo Ker Siang, students conducted their own research, where they made interpretations based on their findings to inform and develop their outcomes. Through the lens of visual narration, visual experience and conceptual intention, the artworks created augment and communicate their views and aspirations for keeping heritage buildings in our land-scarce country.  
  
We were honoured to meet Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development, and Mr S. Dhanabalan on 21 October at the 2019 Architectural Heritage Awards where the exhibition was opened. We thank Mr Lee for his support of the exhibition and for taking the time to find out more about each artwork.

On 23 November, our students joined residents of Bukit Pasoh and public members in celebrating Singapore's built heritage at the URA Day Out At Tanjong Pagar. Our students brought along their easels, templates of shophouses, markers and other art materials to invite visitors to draw their memories and aspirations for shophouses conserved in Singapore. Built in various styles that reflect the economic situation and influences of its times, shophouses are indeed our cherished heritage gems! Our students had the chance to meet Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry, and Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Finance and Second Minister for Education, at the Day Out as well. Thank you for Ministers for the encouragement and to everyone who joined us for this interactive activity!
