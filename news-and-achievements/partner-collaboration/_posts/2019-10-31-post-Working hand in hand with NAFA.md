We are delighted to have renewed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) on 2 July 2019. The renewal of the MOU continues to offer a diverse articulation pathways for our students and it also opens up more collaboration opportunities between the two institutions. Thank you NAFA for working hand in hand with us to nurture artistic talents and creative leaders for the future!
