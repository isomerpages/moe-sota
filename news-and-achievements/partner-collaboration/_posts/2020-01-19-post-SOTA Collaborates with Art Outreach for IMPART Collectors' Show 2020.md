We kicked off the year with an exciting collaboration with Art Outreach Singapore for Singapore Art Week 2020. It was a privilege to have access to such a collection of local and international art from exclusive and private collections right at our doorstep!

  

At the opening, SOTA Principal, Mrs Mary Seah shared with guests about how such collaboration opportunities help provide authentic learning for our students beyond the classroom, which is what we look for in every partnership. It was also an honour to meet one of the international artists featured in the show, Yinka Shonibare CBE.

As part of our partnership with Art Outreach Singapore, selected Visual Arts students also had the opportunity to attend a guided tour by curatorial advisor for the IMPART Collectors' Show 2020, Mr Tan Boon Hui as well as a talk by international artist Yinka Shonibare CBE at his site-specific installation at The Arts House.

Hearing and learning from these established individuals in the arts industry helped the students present draw connections between what they have learnt in the classroom and the real world. Thank you Art Outreach for making this possible!
