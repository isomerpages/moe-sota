Our staff and students took part in an exciting school-wide initiative for the Housing Development Board (HDB)'s nationwide community art project early this year. The project aims to celebrate the future of HDB and to capture the aspirations of Singapore’s youth and their dreams for the future of HDB living under the theme "Our HDB, Our Home. Together We Paint Our Future". It was originally an initiative that was supposed to be worked on by a group of students. However, SOTA was inspired by the project’s mission and decided to turn it into a school-wide initiative. Despite it being a large-scale initiative, it was led by a group of seven Year 6 students.

Through this collaboration, SOTA created almost 900 pieces of art including eight giant totems, eight large canvases, 470 A4 art cards and 400 pieces of digital art for HDB Community Week which was launched on 24 July 2021. All artworks were curated by architect-turned-installation artist Mr Sun Yu-li and can be viewed&nbsp;[here](https://www.facebook.com/SingaporeHDB/posts/4970559639637549).  
  
In addition, we were honoured to be given the opportunity to meet Mr Sun who did a sharing with us. We would like to thank Mr Sun for taking the time to meet our students to share about his experience, further inspiring us on our journey in making arts come to life.
