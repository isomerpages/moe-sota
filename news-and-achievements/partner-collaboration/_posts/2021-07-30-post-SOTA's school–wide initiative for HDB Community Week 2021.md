Our staff and students took part in an exciting school-wide initiative for the Housing Development Board (HDB)'s nationwide community art project early this year. The project aims to celebrate the future of HDB and to capture the aspirations of Singapore’s youth and their dreams for the future of HDB living under the theme "Our HDB, Our Home. Together We Paint Our Future". It was originally an initiative that was supposed to be worked on by a group of students. However, SOTA was inspired by the project’s mission and decided to turn it into a school-wide initiative. Despite it being a large-scale initiative, it was led by a group of seven Year 6 students.
