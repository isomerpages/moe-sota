In yet another exciting collaboration with Singapore Night Festival, the SOTA West Plaza area was lit during the week-long festivities from 23 to 30 August 2019!

Year 1 and 2 Visual Arts students crafted _Fly by Night_, a series of free hanging wire sculptures exploring the notion of flight. These sculptures were suspended from a tree that visitors discovered with the use of handheld UV light torches. The sculptures were presented in the form of planes, rockets, bugs, birds or animals in flight. Created out of thin wires, they resemble a drawing or line in space, discoverable only when lights are shone.

On 29 and 30 August 2019, _Pugs in Pockets,_ a student band from SOTA, put on a show-stopping performance at the SOTA West Plaza Steps. The band, along with guest singers and guest performers from the SOTA Pop Ensemble, played a combination of funk, pop and jazz music.

  

SOTA is proud to contribute to and be a part of the vibrant Bras Basah arts and heritage district. We look forward to more of such collaborations with our partners!
