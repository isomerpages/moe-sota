Organised by Foden’s Band, Whit Friday is an annual brass band march contest held in northwest England. Due to COVID-19 safety restrictions, the last two editions of the event were held online.  
   
Capitalising on this unique learning opportunity, several Music students submitted their performance for this year’s Whit Friday. Despite SOTA's ineligibility to participate as contestants due to instrumentation reasons, Foden's Band nevertheless kindly accepted our entry for this year's edition as an online performance.  
   
Titled “March of the Sotongs”, their march embodied the sotong’s quick thinking, adaptability, and intelligence, which are traits that our students strive for throughout their learning journey.  
  
Well done students! You can watch/listen to their performance here:
