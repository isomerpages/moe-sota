Last year, our Music students, alumni, and faculty members had the opportunity to participate in the 2020 International Virtual Choir Project.  
   
Organised by Maestro Luciano Bibiloni and the Orchestre du Rhin (France), the project saw musicians from Argentina, France, Russia, Spain, the Philippines, and Singapore come together to perform “Hacia el Mañana (Tomorrow is Today)”.  
   
It was heartening to see the SOTA community, past and present, work together and contribute to the choir. For our students, the event’s virtual setting and international collaboration also represented a unique experience and learning opportunity.
