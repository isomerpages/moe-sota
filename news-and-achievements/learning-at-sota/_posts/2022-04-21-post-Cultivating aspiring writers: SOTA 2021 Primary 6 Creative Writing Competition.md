Organised by the Literary Arts faculty, the annual Primary 6 Creative Writing Competition encourages pupils from all backgrounds who have a passion for writing to showcase their creativity and imagination. This year marked the fifth edition of the competition, and invited participants to submit an original story, of no more than 450 words, based on one of the following prompts:  
  
1\. Write a story that contains the phrase, “This was clearly NOT a dream.”  
2\. Write a story in which chicken rice plays a significant role.  
3\. Imagine you open the door and you find a giant box with your name printed on it.          What happens next?  
4\. Write a story that ends with the phrase, “All he could do was give me a high-five.”  
  
This year, we received over 1500 submissions from primary schools across Singapore. 50 finalists were invited to a free short story writing workshop, and 23 were eventually named the winners of various book vouchers.  
   
The Primary 6 Creative Writing Competition helps SOTA interact and connect with young and passionate writers. These initiatives enhance our outreach to artistically inclined primary school pupils, while cultivating and honing their talents in the arts.  
   
Thank you to all who participated in this year's SOTA Primary 6 Creative Writing Competition, and our sincerest congratulations once again to the winners and finalists!
