Earlier in February, we were privileged to have theatre veterans Mr Haresh Sharma, Ms Karen Tan and Ms Koh Wan Ching, for a theatre industry talk. It was enriching to hear about their experiences on collaborative and devised theatre. Our graduating IBCP Theatre students later presented their take on Mr Sharma's play 'History, Whose Story', directed by SOTA Theatre faculty member Ms Serena Ho. We are glad Mr Sharma enjoyed the play and we appreciate his encouragement and support for our aspiring young artists.
