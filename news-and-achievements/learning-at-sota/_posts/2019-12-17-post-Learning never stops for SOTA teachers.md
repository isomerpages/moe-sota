In November, our teachers came together for three weeks of training, planning, and bonding. In addition to planning and preparing for the upcoming school year, the teachers shared ideas on integrating arts across disciplines and had intensive discussions on how to nurture cultural leaders of tomorrow. Through workshops and learning journeys, the teachers also explored tools that could be useful in the classroom to engage students and improve learning outcomes.

Each faculty also had the opportunity to strengthen camaraderie through a variety of faculty cohesion and team-building activities, such as sports, arts, cooking, and games.

At the end of three weeks, we also bade farewell to some of our teachers. While some of the teachers continue to fuel their passion for teaching in other educational institutions, such as Mr Keith Ang who would be returning to MOE, others go on to pursue their interests in other areas. We thank all of them for their contributions and wish them all the best in their future endeavours. Thank you for being part of the SOTA family!
