As part of a Teachers' Day feature on former students who were inspired by their teachers to join the teaching fraternity,&nbsp;[Seithi Mediacorp](https://www.facebook.com/tamilnewsmediacorp/posts/3516614771703087)&nbsp;filmed a conversation between SOTA Music faculty member Mr Ramu Thiruyanam and Class of 2016 Music alumnus Pavethren s/o Kanagarethinam.

  

On being asked how he developed an interest in teaching, Pavethren said to Mr Ramu, "You taught me for four years... Your positive energy was comforting and something I appreciated. Like what you had mentioned, the students of today are going to lead society tomorrow. I want to be able to have the opportunity to teach them, and this is my way of giving back."

  

Mr Ramu also shared about the photo he was holding at in the clip (2:39). "This captured a very important moment in time for Pave. He was at the crossroads of making his life changing decision of where he would want to go to pursue his degree, and what he should do after completing national service. That was the day I met him for a quick coffee session to give him some advice - because of this, he decided to pursue teaching as a career."

  

It is so heartwarming to see the positive influence and passion of our teachers inspiring the next generation of educators and cultural leaders. Thank you Mr Ramu, Pavethren and all teachers for their dedication in moulding the future of our nation!
