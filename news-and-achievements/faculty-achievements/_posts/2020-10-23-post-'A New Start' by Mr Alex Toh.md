Congratulations to Film faculty member Mr Alex Toh on his award-winning short film,&nbsp;_A New Start_! The film follows the story of an ex-convict who works hard to change himself and his struggles to start anew in a changing urban landscape and society. Mr Toh explores the notion of forgiveness and how every day is a test of one's commitment to a new self in this film. In creating this short film, he hopes to convey a meaningful message - that our society needs more compassion and forgiveness for the people who have committed mistakes in their life and are putting effort to change themselves.
