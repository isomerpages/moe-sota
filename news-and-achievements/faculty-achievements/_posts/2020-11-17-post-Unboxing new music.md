Created during the pandemic, "Unboxing New Music" is a digital programme that features some of the finest composers and performers from Singapore and Asia. This Singapore International Festival of Arts series features not one, but two musicians from SOTA's Music faculty!

  

Written by Class of 2014 Music alumna Koh Cheng Jin, 'YAMA' has both eastern and western influences, reflecting Cheng Jin's background in Yang Qin and Western Composition. Her composition captures the colour and intrigue of Yan Luo Wang, the Chinese deity of the Underworld. In addition, the performance of this piece also introduces the newly-minted Singaporean group, Ensemble Ã†quilibrium, which Music faculty member Carolin Ralser is a part of. We are proud to see contributions by the SOTA community in SIFA!
