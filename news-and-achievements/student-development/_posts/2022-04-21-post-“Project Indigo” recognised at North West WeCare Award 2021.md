To help local charity organisation CampusImpact in their mission to empower youths from disadvantaged backgrounds, Year 6 students Joelle Yeo, Megan Yeo, Peniel Ku, and Tay Jing Yun, initiated Project Indigo last year.  
  
Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, the team was determined to stick to their cause of raising funds and conducting academic and art workshops for youths at CampusImpact. Through creativity and grit, the students explored alternative ways to meet their targets, such as organising an online concert with peers from other schools and various online activities.  
  
The team displayed outstanding determination and innovation, and their efforts were recognised with the North West WeCare Award 2021 earlier this year. We are proud to see our students apply their artistic talents by contributing to the local community.  
  
Congratulations students!
