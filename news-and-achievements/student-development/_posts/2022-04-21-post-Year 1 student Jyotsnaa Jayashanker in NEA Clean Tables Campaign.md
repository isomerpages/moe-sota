Earlier this year, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Clean Tables Campaign to remind the community to maintain the cleanliness of public dining spaces. You may have spotted a familiar face in one of their campaign advertisements – Year 1 Theatre student Jyotsnaa Jayashanker!  
   
Dressed in a pink shirt, Jyotsnaa played the role of a character eating a Mala dish at a hawker centre with friends, who were subsequently reminded to clear their tables after their meals.  
   
"I have learnt many things from this," shared Jyotsnaa, "such as resilience (after the long filming hours), helping others (cleaners in the hawker centres), and of course, that we all have a part to play in keeping Singapore clean and green."  
   
We are proud to see our students excel in their fields and contribute to local initiatives. Well done Jyotsnaa!
