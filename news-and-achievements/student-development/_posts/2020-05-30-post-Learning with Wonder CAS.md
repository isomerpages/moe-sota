For their Creativity, Activity and Service (CAS) project, a group of seven Year 6 students, formed WonderCAS, wonderful initiative created specially for primary school pupils to learn more about different art techniques. Comprising Alicia Tay Yee Suen, Anoushka Guli, Claire Gabrielle Djuhadi, Daga Shreyansh Kumar, Gerrica Eponine Tan Fei, Sim Ying Zhi Amelia and Tan Wan Theng, the team created four exciting videos that covered various art techniques. The videos explore topics such as negative space, proportions, photography and more. The students thoughtfully included hands-on demonstrations and sharing of some of their own sketchbooks and artworks.
