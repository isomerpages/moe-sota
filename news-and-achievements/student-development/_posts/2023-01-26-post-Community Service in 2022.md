In 2022, SOTA students and teachers took part in various community service projects which included collaborations with Kim Tian West RC gardening group and Telok Blangah Community Club.&nbsp;  
  
**Mural Wall Painting @ The Giving Garden at Kim Tian West** 
  
In May, 18 of our Year 4 students painted beautiful wall murals at The Giving Garden at Kim Tian West as part of their service learning project. The student volunteers were involved in several gardening workshops by the Kim Tian West RC gardening group, where they grew and harvested produce, and distributed them to the residents. The mural painting at the rooftop garden at Block 119A, Kim Tian Road, was inspired by their time at the Giving Garden.

The unique multi-sensorial art installation at Telok Blangah Community Club is a collaboration between the Telok Blangah Community Arts &amp; Culture Club and SOTA’s Visual Arts teacher, Mr Ryf Zaini. Titled “Written Voyage”, the installation features recycled bottles containing intricate origami ships and penned messages of hopes and aspirations for a better Singapore.

**FamChamps Be.Live Conference 2022**

At the FamChamps Be.Live Conference 2022, two SOTA-organised Family Service Projects were recognised and awarded certificates of achievement. One of the two projects is a collaborative music project, ‘I Will Rise’, featuring our alumni and students, while the other project is a FamChamps Service Learning Project where several Year 4 students produced a series of social media content to promote family bonding among their peers.  
  
Year 6 student Subashri Yuvaraj also received the Sustained Impact Award for her continuous support in voluntary projects through the years.
