In light of the pandemic, student-led a capella group, Syncopella, initiated _Project Imagine_. Their heartfelt rendition of John Lennon's iconic song, _Imagine_, promotes the idea of living in peace and harmony. Through their lovely voices, they hope to spread positivity during these tough times and to show their utmost appreciation towards the frontline healthcare workers for keeping our nation safe. By using song and music, they inspire youths and fellow Singaporeans to remain hopeful, united, and to imagine a brighter future.
