In collaboration with FamChamps, a group of SOTA students were involved in producing and starring in the refreshed FamChamps music video for the theme song, _I Will Rise_. The music video is a rallying call to youths to be change agents in their families by taking active steps to build relational resilience. The song, _I Will Rise_, shows that every young person’s commitment to help their family emerge stronger from this battle fortifies Singapore to weather through future crises.
