A group of SOTA students came together to organise an online fundraising concert during the circuit breaker period in June! The One Hope fundraising concert was live streamed via YouTube on 22 May 2020 and raised funds for The RICE Company Limited's #ENGAGE2 campaign, which cares for at-risk children and youth to keep them safe and well especially during the COVID-19 period.

  

The One Hope team raised a total of $11,305 during the 45-minute show, surpassing the initial target of $10,000. Well done to the organising committee and all the performers!
