SOTA celebrated our teachers on 3 September 2020 with a thoughtfully put together online concert. The SOTA community was treated to a range of performances, including amazing dance items featuring students and teachers, performances by student bands and the return of the teachers' rock band!  
  
Our supportive SOTA Parents and students also showed their appreciation for teachers and staff through special care packs featuring handmade masks, customised notebooks and delectable treats! This year's theme was "Ohana", which means family, and the celebration has definitely made us all feel like one big family despite the pandemic.  
  
Thank you teachers for your dedication and passion for inspiring the next generation! A special shout-out to the SOTA Leadership Academy for the well-organised event.
