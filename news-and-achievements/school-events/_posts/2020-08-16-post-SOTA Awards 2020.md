Celebrating the achievements of our students and Class of 2019 graduates this year was a little different this year! Instead of the usual fanfare, Level Awards was a cosy celebration in individual classes while Awards Day was an online event.

  

Though they could not address the award recipients in person, Guest-of-Honour Mr Loh Lik Peng, Chairman of the SOTA Board, and our Principal Mrs Mary Seah, recorded their speeches to congratulate students and graduates. The Class of 2019 Prime Minister's Valedictorian, Christian Liu, also delivered a heartfelt valedictory speech to his cohort mates through a video.

Some of the 2019 mentors took special effort to consolidate their best wishes to the cohort too! Filming from their homes, the school, and even arts studios, each mentor recorded warm messages of encouragement and congratulations in their own creative ways.

We were pleased to watch a lovely cover of Paloma Faith's&nbsp;_Make Your Own Kind of Music_&nbsp;sung by the Class of 2019. Coordinated by Mr Sean Tobin and music alumna Natasha da Costa, a group of graduates put their voices together to cheer their peers on and to remind all of us to be resilient and stay creative amidst the pandemic.

Thank you to all students, alumni, teachers and parents who have made SOTA Awards 2020 a meaningful celebration! Congratulations once again to all award recipients!
