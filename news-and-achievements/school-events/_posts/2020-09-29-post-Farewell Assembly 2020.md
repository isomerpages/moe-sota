At the end of September, we bid farewell to our Class of 2020 by journeying down memory lane virtually. We're very proud to see how they've matured into young men and women ready to spread their wings and fly. Though their final year at SOTA was fraught with challenges, the cohort displayed remarkable resilience and adaptability, crossing hurdle after hurdle. Their creativity, passion for the arts and camaraderie remained strong, as they cheered each other on to achieve their goals. Through an afternoon of pre-recorded video performances and heartfelt messages, we celebrated the cohort and revisited some of the memorable moments of their six-year journey at SOTA.

On this special occasion, we also thanked the teachers and parents for their support throughout the students' SOTA journey. Special thanks to the Farewell Assembly team for their hard work in putting together the virtual celebration!
