The fourth edition of Sunburst took on the form of a virtual concert this year! In the light of COVID-19, this edition of Sunburst turned to the environment for inspiration. Taking off from the theme of “Air”, “air” as in the basic essential to life and “air” as in to express feelings and thoughts, the 50-minute virtual concert explored the notion of how interaction during the pandemic takes on new and different meanings.

Featuring SOTA students and alumni and members from Muscular Dystrophy Association Singapore (MDAS), the exciting virtual show included a movement piece on a flight of stairs, a touching rendition of John Lennon's "Imagine" by SOTA's student acapella group, Syncopella, and a rousing collaborative performance in the finale.

Organised by The Business Times and directed by Mr Jeremiah Choy, this annual concert since 2017 raises funds in support of MDAS and the SOTA Endowment Fund. We thank all sponsors and supporters, Capitaland, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, DBS Bank, SPH Foundation and more, for making this edition possible!
