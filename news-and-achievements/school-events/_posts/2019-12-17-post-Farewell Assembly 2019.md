In October, we marked the end of the Class of 2019â€™s journey in SOTA with the Farewell Assembly. It was an evening to celebrate the 2019 cohort, and we were delighted to have all the Year 6s, their parents, and teachers, gathered together. Apart from performances and games, the students also prepared touching speeches to thank all the teachers who have guided them through their six-year journey at SOTA.

All the best to our Year 6s as they move on to the next lap of their journey!
