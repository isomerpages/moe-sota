In the third edition of&nbsp;_Sunburst: The Business Times – CapitaLand Fundraising Show_, SOTA students and alumni and members from Muscular Dystrophy Association Singapore (MDAS) came together for an inclusive theatre-with-music production.

Organised by The Business Times and presented by CapitaLand Hope Foundation, the concert took place on 7 November at the SOTA Drama Theatre. The concert raised $275,000 for its two beneficiaries: the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Singapore (MDAS) and the&nbsp;[SOTA Endowment Fund](/getting-involved/donate/). We were honoured to have Mr Sam Tan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and for Social and Family Development, as the Guest-of-Honour.

Curated by artistic director, Jeremiah Choy, and written by SOTA alumnus Krish Natarajan (Theatre, 2013), the 90-minute show followed three characters, performed by Chaney Chia (Theatre, 2015), Thea Haugan (Theatre, Year 4), and Salonee Narang (Theatre, Year 2), as they discover what it means to be inclusive and to celebrate talents of all abilities.

Titled&nbsp;_The Ramp_, the production focused on the challenges behind building an inclusive society. The show included performances by SOTA student band Pocket Pugs, songs and dance by SOTA students and alumni, and even a&nbsp;_pipa_&nbsp;piece by Parveen Kaur (Music, Year 2).

The highlights of the show were undoubtedly the heartwarming moments where MDAS members, together with SOTA students and alumni, joined their voices to perform songs such as&nbsp;_I Am Alive_&nbsp;by JJ Lin and Jason Mraz, and&nbsp;_I Believe_&nbsp;by Fantasia Barrino.

In the same evening, the year-long projects that SOTA and MDAS had been working together on were featured in an exhibition. Digital artworks created by MDAS members and SOTA students in a&nbsp;[joint workshop earlier in October](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/life-culture/digital-art-a-bridge-for-sota-students-and-persons-with-muscular-dystrophy)&nbsp;were displayed outside the SOTA Drama Theatre. Art pieces, such as illustrated story books, a video, and a sculpture, were also presented at the exhibition. These were mementos created by SOTA students who were inspired by the MDAS members, after learning about their experiences through interaction during&nbsp;[their Local Service Learning (LSL) programme](https://www.facebook.com/SOTA.SG/posts/1443927095774079).
