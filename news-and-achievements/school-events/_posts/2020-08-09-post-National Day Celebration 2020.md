This year, we celebrated National Day with a whole suite of videos and class activities. In addition to a pre-recorded Observance Ceremony, we enjoyed a screening of the performances by our talented students and learnt more about Singapore with an online quiz. The Year 5 and 6 students also re-made a music video to the song "Our Singapore". Special thanks to the Leadership Academy (LeAd) team for organising this wonderful celebration. Together, we are a stronger Singapore!
