2022 was an eventful year for the SOTA community as physical gatherings gradually made its way back to school events. Our students had the opportunity to perform and showcase their talents at several school events and festive occasions.

**Year 1 Orientation**

At the beginning of 2022, SOTA welcomed the new cohort with the Year 1 Orientation Programme themed “Soaring Together”. Led by the Year 3 Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs), the new students participated in numerous activities including water games, an amazing race, and escape rooms. Over the two days of the orientation programme, the Year 1 students worked in teams to overcome obstacles while forming new friendships along the way.

**Festivities @ SOTA**

To celebrate the year of Tiger, our students kicked off the&nbsp;**Chinese New Year**&nbsp;celebrations with hands-on activities such as Chinese fan-drawing and lantern-making. They also participated in SOTA’s annual CNY Fashion Runway competition where each class tailored a costume based on the themes “Auspicious” and “Hope for the Future'', before nominating a student to showcase their design. The celebration concluded with a virtual concert with performances by our students and teachers.

In April, the school celebrated&nbsp;**Hari Raya Aidilfitri**&nbsp;with a mini exhibition that broadened the students’ knowledge about the occasion’s beliefs and customs. Students and staff were also encouraged to wear their ethnic attire on this festive occasion.

SOTA celebrated&nbsp;**Deepavali**&nbsp;in October with the theme “Celebrating Joy of Togetherness”. There were class-based celebrations and a mini exhibition in the school to deepen the understanding of the occasion’s traditions. This was also an opportunity for our students and staff to understand the significance of Deepavali.

**International Friendship Day**

SOTA commemorated the International Friendship Day (IFD) in April. Themed “Singapore in Asia”, the event commemorated the importance of kinship between Singapore and our neighbouring countries.&nbsp;

Our students participated in games and quizzes organised by the SOTA Leadership Academy (LeAd) students. These activities illustrated the region’s diversity and promoted the spirit of friendship. Goodie bags prepared by SOTA Parents were also distributed among the students!

**Celebrating the achievements of our students**

At the end of Semester 1, the school put together cohort-based&nbsp;**Level Awards**&nbsp;presentations to acknowledge and recognise the achievements of our students, making it the first in-person edition in two years due to the pandemic. The SOTA community also gathered together for an online&nbsp;**Awards Day**&nbsp;celebration, with Guest-of-Honour Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Second Minister for Law, joining the event virtually.&nbsp;

Congratulations to all award recipients and thank you to the teachers, staff, students, and alumni who helped to make this celebration possible. We take this opportunity to thank our SOTA parents, donors, and partners for their support too!

**National Day celebrations**

At the end of July, students, teachers and staff came together for&nbsp;**SouNDProof**, taking the opportunity to unwind and celebrate the achievements of our Year 5 and 6 students as they embark on the final stretch of their SOTA journey. This event included live performances by students, as well as engaging activity booths to celebrate National Day on SOTA’s rooftop.&nbsp;

A&nbsp;**school-wide celebration**&nbsp;was held on the eve of National Day, where our students took part in various fun-filled activities to celebrate Singapore’s 57th birthday.

**Thank You for the Memories**

Towards the end of the academic year, we bid farewell to our graduating cohort with the Class of 2022&nbsp;**Farewell Assembly**. It was a memorable event filled with mixed emotions for our Year 6 students as the event brought them through performances, heartfelt speeches, and a video montage featuring the memories of the cohort’s six-year journey in SOTA.

As their Year Mentor Mrs Sara said in her farewell message, the Class of 2022 is a creative, resilient and inspiring group. We wish the Class of 2022 all the best for their future endeavours!

**Impact 2022 — SOTA Fundraising Show**

The inaugural edition of Impact was inspired by the life and works of Tang Da Wu, a local artist who has made significant contributions in shaping Singapore's arts and cultural landscape. The fundraising show featured original works and performance pieces created by our students, alumni, and staff spanning across different artforms. It was especially heartwarming to see the SOTA community come together and collaborate for a meaningful cause.&nbsp;

With our stakeholders’ continuous support and their generous contributions, Impact 2022 successfully raised $235,000 towards the SOTA Endowment Fund!

Together, we can make an Impact!
