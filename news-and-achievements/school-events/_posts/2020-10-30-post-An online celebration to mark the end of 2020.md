To mark the end of an eventful academic year, the annual Final Assembly went online! Instead of gathering as a school, students and teachers remained in their respective classes and watched a pre-recorded video, painstakingly put together by the Leadership Academy (LeAd). The year has thrown many of our plans into disarray but together, we have emerged stronger and have now adapted to a new normal. Every single member of the SOTA community has worked hand in hand to overcome many struggles, from Home-Based Learning to cancellation of physical school events and social distancing. United as a school community, we continue to encourage one another to keep moving towards our goals.
