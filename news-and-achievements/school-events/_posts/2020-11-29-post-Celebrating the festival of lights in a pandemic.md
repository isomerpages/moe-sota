Deepavali still goes on despite a pandemic! This year, a group of staff organised a cozy event with small group activities so that we could still celebrate the festival of lights. Apart from individually packed snacks and henna packets, the most eye-catching part of the celebration was the Rangoli floor design. Known as Kolam in Tamil, Rangoli are floor designs usually made with colourful powder or coloured rice. The designs of Rangoli could be as simple as geometric shapes or as elaborate as impressions of deities, and such designs are often passed from one generation to the next. Thank you to the teachers and staff who organised this special celebration!
