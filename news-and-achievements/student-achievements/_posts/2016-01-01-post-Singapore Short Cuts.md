Three short films by SOTA Film students were selected for this year's Singapore Short Cuts, a programme of the National Museum of Singapore Cinémathèque and supported by the Singapore Film Commission. This year marks the 13th season of Singapore Short Cuts. The programme features a diverse selection of local short films, ranging from documentaries to animation. Previously featured films include works by Victric Thng, Eva Tang, and Boo Junfeng.

The three films were:  

**Void Deck Love Story**&nbsp;Directed by Matthew Foo (Year 6)  <br>
_Void Deck Love Story_&nbsp;strives to capture fleeting shared experiences of the void deck through a series of whimsical encounters.  
(Screened on 15 October 2016)  
  
**The Sarkais**&nbsp;Directed by Joshua Lau (Year 6)  <br>
Like its cryptic title, the heart of&nbsp;_The_&nbsp;_Sarkais_&nbsp;remains a delicate enigma not to be unravelled but savoured.  
(Screened on 22 October 2016)  
  
**Coney Island**&nbsp;Directed by Rashad Bin Faizal (Year 6) <br>
A film about the shifting nature of friendship and the abandonment of youth on Coney island’s characteristically remote woodlands.  
(Screened on 23 October 2016)

Film faculty member Liao Jiekai's short film, The Drawing Room &amp; Episodes from Art Studio, was also featured in this edition.&nbsp;Jiekai’s exploration of the tangible amid the intangible continues with a loose abstraction of Yeng Pway Ngon’s&nbsp;_Art Studio_&nbsp;in the form of a short film.
