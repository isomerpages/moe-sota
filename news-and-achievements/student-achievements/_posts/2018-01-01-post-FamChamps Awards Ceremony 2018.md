We are proud to share that SOTA FamChamps received the&nbsp;_Most Impactful Family Service Project Award_&nbsp;at the FamChamps Awards Ceremony held on 30 June 2018 at ACS Barker Road! This was for organising SOTA Honour Night, an evening of bonding for families that was held in March. SOTA FamChamps, made up of Year 2 students, had started planning for the event since last December.  
  
In addition to the team award, one of our students, Charlene Yong, was also awarded the Outstanding FamChamp Award, given to youths who have displayed strong qualities of being a Family Champion. She is one of only 11 recipients of this award.  
  
Well done, SOTA FamChamps!
