The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has commissioned the design and production of a sculpture to SOTA to mark its 20th anniversary. Year 4 student Rebecca Lee's design was selected and fabricated into a sculpture to emulate the progress and improvements that IRAS has undergone throughout the past 20 years. Singapore's President Dr Tony Tan graced the anniversary celebrations on 31 August 2012 and unveiled the sculpture conceptualised by Rebecca and her four teammates.
