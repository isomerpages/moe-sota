After many weeks of hard work and passion, Team SOTA has emerged from this year's National Schools Xinyao Competition with good news! Year 2 Music student Raine Chiew attained second place in the solo singing category, while over in the group category, honourable mentions were accorded to a band of five SOTA students led by Year 5 Theatre student Marcus Chiau, together with the duo formed by Raine and her sister. Raine also received the online popularity award for the solo category.  
  
The National Schools Xinyao Competition aims to encourage students to enhance their Chinese reading and writing abilities and cultivate a love for local Chinese music (_xinyao_). This is the first year that Raine took part in the solo category despite having been participating since 2016, and also the first time that SOTA sent in a group entry.  
  
Congratulations to Team SOTA! Keep your passion burning!
