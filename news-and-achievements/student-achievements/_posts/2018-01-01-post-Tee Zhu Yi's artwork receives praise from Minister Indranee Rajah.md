As part of a collaboration between SOTA and the Ministry of Law, five linoleum print designs by Visual Arts students were selected by the Ministry of Law to be reproduced into their corporate gifts. Commending our students on their work and efforts, Minister Indranee Rajah showcased the print created by Year 2 student Tee Zhu Yi in a Facebook post. Named "Their Own Findings", his work is intended as a vibrant depiction of Singapore's identity as a multicultural nation, bound by the bonds shared between our people.
