This year's National Day Parade (NDP) featured a performance of&nbsp;_[Stay With You](https://www.facebook.com/89175368528/videos/977938249295751/)_&nbsp;by Singaporean singer-songwriters JJ Lin and Stefanie Sun. Accompanying them on the cello was SOTA's very own Heema Izzati Zainudin! The Year 2 Visual Arts student is a multi-instrumentalist, well-versed in not just the cello, but also the piano and ukulele.

Heema was also featured in the song&nbsp;_We Will Get There_&nbsp;alongside other singers including Dick Lee, NAMIE, Rebekah Sangeetha Dorai, and Nathan Hartono.



Besides the NDP, Heema performed at this year's ChildAid, which premiered online on 15 July 2020. Organised by The Straits Times and The Business Times, this annual fundraising concert supports socially and financially disadvantaged children. This year was Heema's third time performing at ChildAid, which she shared was "a privilege and honour". We're proud of you, Heema!
