SOTA's Chinese instrumentalist, Koh Cheng Jin, 16, has been awarded the first prize (Yangqin, Youth category) in the 2012 National Chinese Music Competition. In addition, the SOTA Chinese Percussion Ensemble also won the first prize in the Ensemble category. The winners will perform with the Singapore Chinese Orchestra during the Prize Winners' Concert at the Singapore Conference Hall on Sunday, 9 December 2012.

The biennial National Chinese Music Competition was first organised in 1998 by the National Arts Council and serves as a platform for music excellence. It aims to develop the performing skills of musicians in Singapore; to improve musical standards; and to identify potential music talents. It also provides opportunities for young musicians to perform in a competitive situation before an international jury. Contestants compete in the Dizi, Erhu, Guzheng, Pipa, Sheng, Suona, Yangqin, Zhongruan and Ensemble categories.
