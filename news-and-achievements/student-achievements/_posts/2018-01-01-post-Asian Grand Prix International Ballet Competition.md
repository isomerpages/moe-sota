They were guided by mentors Mr Ng Teck Voon, Ms Cheah Mei Sing and Ms Liliana Durlai. Kenzo and Vivian made it through to the finals of their respective divisions, and Kenzo was awarded the Gold medal in the Junior A category. In addition, he was offered short term scholarships at the following prestigious dance institutions - the New Zealand School of Dance, English National Ballet School and the National Ballet School of Canada.
