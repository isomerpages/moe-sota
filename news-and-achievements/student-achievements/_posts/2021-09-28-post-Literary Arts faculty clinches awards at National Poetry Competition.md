Our Literary Arts faculty clinched several awards at this year's National Poetry Competition, organised by Poetry Festival Singapore. With the theme "Community", the competition saw students Isabelle Lim (Year 4) and Maegan Tan (Year 3) placing 1st and 2nd respectively in the Junior category, while faculty member Mr Ian Goh placed 2nd in the Senior category. Isabelle also performed her poem at the online awards ceremony held earlier this August.  
  
Congratulations Isabelle, Maegan and Mr Goh! View their works below.
