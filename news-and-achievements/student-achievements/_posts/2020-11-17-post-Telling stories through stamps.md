Every stamp tells a story. The Draw My Stamp Story Art Competition organised by the Singapore Philatelic Museum encourages primary and secondary school students to design their own stamps to tell a story. The 2020 edition saw more than 800 entries submitted. SOTA Visual Arts students Justin Teo (Year 1), Alaina Chia, Celeste Tay, Chew Wei Dong, Chua Yun Xuan (Year 2s), and Freesia Tong (Year 3) won Silver Awards this year. Congratulations to all winners and participants! Take a look at the winning designs on the Singapore Philatelic Museum website&nbsp;[HERE](https://www.nhb.gov.sg/spm/programmes/competitions).
