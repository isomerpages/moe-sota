Recently concluded, the Singapore Futures Youth Competition 2021 challenged participants to imagine how Singapore will look like in 2040, when Singapore celebrates its 75th birthday. Organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) Executive Education, this competition saw participants working on a presentation to "pitch" their vision for Singapore. We're proud to share that our Year 5 students were awarded placings, and their efforts recognised!  
  
"It was a rewarding experience as it allowed me to meet people from a variety of schools who gave thought-provoking presentations," said Sarah Wong Min. Wong Himari experienced the same, also appreciating the opportunity to think from macro perspectives, having "not previously considered the future of Singapore in 19 years time". Olivia Liu shared similar sentiments: "Seeing the larger picture can really help us understand and interact with issues of a national and global significance."  
  
We're also stoked that Tamayo Mariah Allen Bacolod, who was part of the 1st placed team, was invited to be a panelist on LKYSPP Executive Education's&nbsp;_Futures Forward_&nbsp;webinar series, viewable&nbsp;[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0nRluU0zCk). Said Mariah, "The biggest takeaway from this was truly recognising the voices of others. It's incredibly inspiring to see people my age present so many unique facets of Singapore's future, all with so much passion and creativity. It's made me realise just how important it is to invite youths into conversations like these, especially since it'll be us spearheading the progress of our future in due time."  
  
Well done, students!
