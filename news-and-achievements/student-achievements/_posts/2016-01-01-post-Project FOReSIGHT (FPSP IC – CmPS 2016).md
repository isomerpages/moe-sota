Project FOReSIGHT, consisting of five Year 4 students, has done SOTA and Singapore proud in the Middle Division category of the Future Problem Solving Programme International Conference (FPSP IC) – Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Competition!

Allison Tan, Chua Zixin, Koon Tian Hui, Tang Hanyu, and Janice Yap were up against 27 teams from all around the world, and emerged as overall Grand Champion amidst the stiff competition.

The five students embarked on an 18-month project since January 2015 with the aim to address the problem of the increasing rate of childhood myopia in Singapore, and to combat the lack of knowledge and understanding of eye care among parents and children. Their project met the CmPS Qualifying Round criteria in August 2015, and the team progressed to the CmPS National Finals in October 2015. Project FOReSIGHT came in first in the Middle Division category in the National Finals, which qualified them for the international competition this June where they emerged champion.

The team was motivated to start Project FOReSIGHT as four out of five members have myopia due to poor eye care when they were younger. To tackle the problem, they decided to reach out to children aged 4-12 and their parents on strategies to delay the early onset of childhood myopia.

By capitalising on their artistic talents, life skills, and critical and creative thinking problem-solving skills, the team conducted surveys, did in-depth research and held interviews with experts from the field. The students went a step further to produce their own educational materials, hold public booths at external educational institutions, give awareness talks and presentations at kindergarten and primary schools, and conduct storytelling sessions on eye-care strategies and habits at the National Library. Project FOReSIGHT has since successfully reached out to approximately 3000 people locally and 400 people overseas.
