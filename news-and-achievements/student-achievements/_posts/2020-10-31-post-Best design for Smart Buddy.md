Year 1 Visual Arts student Justin Teo won first prize in the POSB Design your Smart Buddy Competition (13-17 years old category)! The theme for the competition was to encourage young people to start saving money for the future. As such, Justin decided to highlight this message by emphasising on the word “save” and drew coins that were falling downwards into a bank at the bottom of the watch. Congratulations on the thoughtful and aesthetic design, Justin!

  

The POSB Design your Smart Buddy Competition was open to all students aged 7 - 17 years old across Singapore from 15 June to 23 September this year. POSB Smart Buddy is the world’s first in-school savings and payments wearable on a child’s wrist.
