The Lee Kuan Yew Prize Award Ceremony and Banquet celebrates the winners of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize and Water Prize. This year, the event was held on 9 July 2018 at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore. Our students - Parveen Kaur (Pipa), Natasha Michella da Costa (Voice) and Michael Huang (Piano) - had the honour of performing at the event, and had the opportunity to have a photograph taken with Guest-of-Honour President Halimah Yacob!
