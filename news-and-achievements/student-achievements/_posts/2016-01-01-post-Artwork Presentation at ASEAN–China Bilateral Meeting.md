Year 4 Visual Arts student, Chin Ruisi, flew to Laos to present her artwork personally to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the ASEAN-China bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit. Her artwork was the winning entry of the ASEAN-China: 25 Years of Friendship and Cooperation youth art competition, organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations.  
  
On the inspiration behind her artwork, Ruisi said,&nbsp;"Friendship is something I personally value a lot and therefore I created this art piece titled "together as one" to represent the friendship between ASEAN and CHINA. Both friendship handshakes and the friendship bracelets on the hands highlight the strong relationship between the two. Friendship bracelets are usually made out of a number of strings tied together securely and often given to a friend. Furthermore, in order to wear the friendship bracelets, it requires a friend to help you to tie it together securely. Hence this could perhaps suggest that the friendship is not just between ASEAN but both ASEAN and China."

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also mentioned Ruisi in his Facebook post, which can be found&nbsp;[HERE](https://www.facebook.com/leehsienloong/photos/a.1198888986840472.1073742343.125845680811480/1198889146840456/?type=3&amp;theater).
