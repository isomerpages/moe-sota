Congratulations to our Year 1 student Janelle Tan who received the Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence (LKY-ARE)! This prestigious national level award recognises students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic spheres, and exemplify qualities in the desired outcomes of education such as being confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens. Well done, Janelle!
