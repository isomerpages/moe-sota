The National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) is an annual competition for students in Singapore that aims to develop their passion for literature. Due to COVID-19 safety restrictions, this year's edition was the first to be held online. Despite these challenges, we're thrilled to share that our students have done us proud, walking away with awards in three categories:

*   Year 1 students Jyotsnaa&nbsp;Jayashanker,&nbsp;Nadia&nbsp;Chan, Jade Liew, Ashley Cheong and Ng Rei Yin received the Commendation Award in the Choral Speaking category
*   Year 2 students Celestine Groleau, Kevin Ho, Jace&nbsp;Phipatanasuphorn, Sophia Khoo, Kiara Goh,&nbsp;Sophia Boladian,&nbsp;Janelle Tan,&nbsp;Tesslyn Tan,&nbsp;Violette Lovell and Wong Jun Yi received the Silver Award in the Book Trailer category
*   And Year 2 Dance student Sophie Ter received the Gold Award in the Flash Fiction (Lower Secondary) category.

It is always inspiring to see our students excel and achieve artistic excellence. Congratulations and well done to all award recipients!
