### Director, Corporate Planning &amp; Services

Justine Tan graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. She started her career in the field of marketing – during which she conceptualised and executed campaigns for a range of products spanning from the IT sector to shopping malls and radio stations – before moving on to join the Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE).


Starting her journey at MOE with Ang Mo Kio Secondary School as a school administration manager, Justine subsequently joined the Human Resources (HR) Group of MOE Headquarters (HQ), to manage schools’ staffing needs inclusive of both teaching and non-teaching staff. During her time at MOE HQ, she also served as part of the pioneering team that conceptualised and launched a single-point contact hub for MOE staff, which helped serve the HR needs of staff efficiently.


Prior to her posting to SOTA, Justine was the Vice-Principal (Administration) at Cedar Girls’ Secondary School for seven years, during which she was also part of the pioneer team of school leaders of the Victoria-Cedar Alliance. At Cedar, her key areas of responsibility included administration, corporate communications, estate management, human resources, safety and security, student affairs and school events.


Justine’s personal belief is that all individuals are unique with their own strengths, and that everyone wants to do good. She advocates positive thinking and living life to the fullest, and hopes to bring out the best in each individual. Fulfilling her calling to serve the nation through education services, she also strongly believes in the importance of roles that non-teaching staff play in the education sector – be it in a school environment or at MOE HQ.
