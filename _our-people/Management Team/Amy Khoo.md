### Vice-Principal, Arts

Amy Khoo is a visual storyteller who began honing her craft at Channel NewsAsia for which she produced a variety of current affairs programmes for local and regional audiences. Seven years as a broadcast journalist gave her many opportunities to see the world through a camera lens.  
  
Amy continues to deepen her passion for the art of visual storytelling through her photography that captures moments reflecting the human spirit and emotion.  
  
In 2005, she joined Republic Polytechnic and took on a leading role in the launch of its newest faculty, the School of Technology for the Arts (STA).  
  
Through her concurrent appointments as Assistant Director (Academic), and Programme Chair for the Diploma in New Media, Amy exercised leadership not only in setting up the new faculty’s academic and administrative processes, but also in shaping the curriculum and assessment design of five diplomas in the areas of new media, sound art, technical theatre and arts management, game design, and interactive media.  
  
Her seven years at Republic Polytechnic also provided Amy with the opportunity to expand all-around leadership competencies through appointment as Assistant Director (Capability Development) for the Centre for Enterprise and Communication where she led the faculty initiatives to build professional discipline, leadership, and character in students, and to enhance and expand the Centre’s adult education offerings in the areas of communication and citizenship skills.  
  
Just as the fusion of images, sounds, and words can bring a story to life and leave an emotional footprint on the viewer, Amy believes there are powerful stories that can be told through various art forms. She hopes to be able to create the kind of learning environment that will encourage students to imagine the possibilities their art provides, and nurture them to realise their potential.  
  
Amy Khoo earned her Bachelor of Communication Studies from the Nanyang Technological University, and a Master of Social Sciences (International Studies) from the National University of Singapore.
