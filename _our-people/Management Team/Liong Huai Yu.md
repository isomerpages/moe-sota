### Vice-Principal

Liong Huai Yu believes that education is a lifelong journey of discovery, growth and service. He believes that people explore, enquire and grow by approaching learning with a sense of wonder, openness, vulnerability, responsibility and a comfort with ambiguity and diversity. Opportunities and possibilities can be found at the intersections of disciplines, ideas and people. Through exploration and learning, we listen, contribute, hold tensions, bounce back, and show up, as we connect, enrich and bring joy and hope to the lives of others.  
  
An art educator by training, Huai Yu is grateful to have the opportunities to serve in two secondary schools, an integrated programme school and MOE HQ, before joining the team at SOTA from the end of 2022.
