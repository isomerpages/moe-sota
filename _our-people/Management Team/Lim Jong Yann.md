### Dean, Affective

A recipient of the Public Service Commission Scholarship (Teaching), Lim Jong Yann graduated with Honours (Second Upper) from the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Chinese Language and Chinese Studies. She went on to obtain her Postgraduate Diploma in Education from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and now teaches Chinese at SOTA. She believes that language is a powerful tool in shaping one’s cognitive ability and perception of the world.

  

Prior to joining SOTA, Jong Yann was Subject Head of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) at Nanyang Junior College where she planned and oversaw strategic development of the college’s CCA programmes as well as their day-to-day operations.

  

Of note was her contribution as Head of the Aesthetics Committee which saw her charting the college’s Arts programme to inculcate students’ appreciation for the arts. She was also a member of the Student Leadership Committee and was actively involved in creating opportunities for student leaders to develop their potential.

  

Jong Yann is a strong advocate of mental skills. She is passionate about coaching students to help them achieve peak performance in both the cognitive and physical domains. She believes that her deep passion for the arts, especially in singing and dancing, enables her to better connect with her students to bring out the best in them.
