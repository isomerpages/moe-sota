### Vice-Principal, Academic &amp; Affective

Pauline Ann Tan believes that life is an adventure to be lived to the fullest. This underpins her philosophy of education: to empower every young person to make the best of his/her gifts for the greater good. Prior to being appointed Vice-Principal at SOTA, she was the Vice-Principal at Cedar Girls’ Secondary School and part of the pioneer team of school leaders of the Victoria-Cedar Alliance. Her experience in the education service also includes being a primary school teacher in St. Andrew’s Junior School, a Curriculum Planning Officer, and Head of the English department at Dunman High School during the nascent years of the school’s six-year Integrated Programme.

  

In her personal adventures, Ann has caught a glimpse of the human spirit during a one-month Outward Bound School trek in the Australian outback before going on to scale a series of mountains, including Mt Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia, Fansipan in Vietnam, and Mt Fuji in Japan. She enjoys hiking and basking in the wonder and beauty of nature.

  

Ann graduated with a first class Honours in English Literature and English Language from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. She also attained a Master's in Social Sciences (International Studies) from the National University of Singapore. She is an aspiring volunteer docent at the National Gallery Singapore and is excited about sharing the myriad perspectives that art offers with those she will encounter.
