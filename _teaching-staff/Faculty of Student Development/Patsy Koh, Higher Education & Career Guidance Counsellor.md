Patsy Koh graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in English Literature (1996). She went on to pursue a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore (1997), as well as Masters of Education, specialising in Applied Linguistics (2011).  
  
In her teaching career, Patsy taught General Paper and Project Work in Hwa Chong Institution for 11 years, before she went on to head the Education &amp; Career Guidance Committee. She actively grew the ECG department in Hwa Chong and led the team responsible for the implementation of school-wide programmes supporting students’ exploration of post-tertiary education options, liaising with university partners to run information sessions, college fairs, and conduct workshops. She also oversaw the launch of the MOE eCareers.sg portal and the expansion of the internship programme with industry partners.  
  
Seeking further personal growth and development, she moved on to serve as a college counsellor in Raffles Institution, where she was responsible for advising students on college choices in small group consultations or one-to-one sessions, seeking to help students build plans for success as they consider overseas study options. There, she discovered that students coming from varied backgrounds and entertaining a vast array of interests made her role as college counsellor a fascinating journey. She continued to oversee education fairs at Raffles and hosted information sessions by visiting school representatives.  
  
Patsy’s heartbeat is for college and career readiness. She finds it personally rewarding to help young people gain clarity about their personhood, and assist them in realising their educational goals. She believes her years of teaching and working with students in a college counselling capacity have given her a deeper appreciation of students and concerns they may have.  
  
In her free time, Patsy loves learning more about essential oils and enjoys yoga.
