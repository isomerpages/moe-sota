Sascia Pellegrini was a gifted piano player from a very young age and is now a seasoned percussionist and performer/composer. He was trained in percussion, piano, and composition at the Italian Conservatory 'G.Puccini' in La Spezia. He joined percussion, composition and conducting classes at IRCAM (Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music) in Paris, where he was under the guidance of Steven Schick, Sylvio Gualda and Peter Eotvos. In the course of these studies, he met, learned from and shared ideas with a variety of stimulating composers and performers.  
  
Sascia’s expertise and research is in intermedia, and interdisciplinary arts, with a strong background in music composition and dance choreography: in his research he has a particular interest in the phenomenology of the act of performance and its implications upon interdisciplinary thinking and praxis. He often leads workshops on these themes in universities and music schools for composers, instrumentalists, and performers. He has also conducted courses at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Hong Kong University, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Baptist University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, Singapore’s Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and the Shanghai Conservatory of Music.  
  
Sascia’s contributions have appeared in publications and conferences such as Indeterminacy Conference (UK), Hauntology, Turmoil, Change Symposium (Scotland), ITAC5 conference (Korea, US), Open Space Magazine (US), South China Morning Post (Hong Kong), Culture Magazine (HK), Milk Magazine (HK), Momm Dance Magazine (Korea), etc.  
  
Sascia has written music for various ensembles and has developed choreography and visual works often in collaboration with dancers and other media artists. In recent years, Sascia has developed a close collaboration with the composer Ben Boretz and the singer Yungchen Llamo. As a percussionist/composer, he has performed extensively in Italy, France, Germany, China, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, where he lived for almost six years before moving to Singapore. He has performed in concert halls, theaters, art galleries, art spaces and art festivals, primarily as a soloist and composer. He also collaborated with major dance companies in Hong Kong and Singapore such as CCDC (City Contemporary Dance Company), HKDC (Hong Kong Dance Company), Frontier Danceland Dance Company and the choreographer Helen Lai.  
  
Sascia is currently a Composition and Integrated Arts Teacher at The School of the Arts of Singapore and Editor of Southeast Asia for the Open Space Magazine of New York. Sascia holds a Master Degree in Arts, Pedagogy and Practice from Goldsmith University, UK.
