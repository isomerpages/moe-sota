Award winning Singaporean composer Lee Jinjun has been actively involved in the music scene as both a composer and performer for the past 10 years. As a member of the Composers Society of Singapore, his works have been conducted by renowned composer Johan de Meij, Mark Heron, Alvin Arumugam, and Adrian Tan, and performed by the Singapore Wind Symphony (SWS), Singapore Management University Symphonia and the Raffles Winds. Recently, his piece&nbsp;_Autumnal Fireworks_&nbsp;clinched the first prize at the Singapore International Band Festival Composition Competition in the Grade 4 category. In 2014,&nbsp;_What Does the Future Hold?_&nbsp;won the first prize at the World Projects Composition Contest 2014, and was premiered by the Riverside City College Wind Ensemble in the Walt Disney Concert Hall as part of the 2015 Los Angeles International Music Festival. His orchestral work&nbsp;_Terraces_&nbsp;earned him a Fellowship in the Banaue Music Composition Competition 2018.

  

Recently, Jinjun was commissioned by the Ministry of Education Arts Education Branch to compose the set pieces for the Singapore Youth Festival 2019 Arts Presentation for concert bands, resulting in the creation of two modular wind band works&nbsp;_Festival on Earth_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_Party in Space_. His trumpet solo showpiece&nbsp;_Variations on Chan Mali Chan_&nbsp;was premiered by trumpet virtuoso Joe Burgstaller in 2014. The Straits Times hailed&nbsp;_Variations_&nbsp;as “the local answer to Arban’s fantastic Carnival of Venice Variations.” It has since been performed by leading euphonium soloist Steven Mead in a euphonium edition both in Singapore and many other countries worldwide, including China, United States of America, Belgium, Germany and Spain. He has since then received commissions from major figures and organisations, such as Timothy Reynish, the Royal Northern College of Music, Brighouse and Rastrick Band and the Orchestra of the Music Makers. Jinjun also writes arrangements for symphonic bands and orchestras, including music by major Singaporean musical figures such as Dick Lee, Shun Ng and Jeremy Monteiro.

  

Besides writing for large ensembles, Jinjun also actively composes chamber music.&nbsp;_Sea Stars_&nbsp;for trombone quintet was performed by the Trombone Society (Singapore), as part of the Singapore Low Brass Festival 2015.&nbsp;_Four Dances for Three_, a trumpet, trombone and piano was also performed in “Cool Classics”, a series of public recitals presented by Esplanade - Theatres by the Bay. His Concertino for Euphonium for solo euphonium and brass sextet was recorded by Steven Mead in his latest album&nbsp;_Dream Times_.&nbsp;_Who's Hungary?_&nbsp;was also performed by Quintoot as part of the RNCM Chamber Music Festival 2017 Budafest. He was subsequently commissioned by the Royal Northern College of Music to compose a fanfare for the 2016 Congregation Ceremony.

  

Jinjun also played the role of a mentor for the Young Composer’s Challenge organised by the SWS, and has also given talks on various aspects of composition at the YCC as well as at the Wind Band Association Singapore Youth Band Festival and the Band Directors Association Festival Winds Honour Band. He also ran a composition course for students of the Naval Base Secondary Symphonic Band, with the result of the students composing their own piece of music for the band to play in celebration of the school's 60th anniversary.

  

Jinjun studied at the Royal Northern College of Music at the Masters level, under the tutelage of Adam Gorb and Paul Patterson.

  

Besides composing, Jinjun also performs as a trumpeter for numerous groups, including the Orchestra of the Music Makers (OMM), Windstars Ensemble, Philharmonic Winds, B5 Brass Quintet, and has taken part in the prestigious Cheltenham Festival of Music with OMM. He also studied the trumpet under Singapore Symphony Orchestra Principal Trumpet Jon Dante at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music under a full scholarship.
