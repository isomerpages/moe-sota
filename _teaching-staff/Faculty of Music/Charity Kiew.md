Charity’s musical journey has been dynamic and exciting. Her technical mastery and musical sensitivity has led her to play with orchestras around the world including the Berlin Philharmonic, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Sun Symphony Orchestra (Hanoi, Vietnam) and Guiyang Symphony Orchestra (Guizhou, China). In Singapore, she has appeared with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Chinese Orchestra, Metropolitan Festival Orchestra and Singapore Lyric Opera.

As an award winner, Charity won First Prize at the New York Concerti Sinfonietta’s International Shining Stars Debut Series, winner of the Manhattan School of Music Fuchs Chamber Music Competition, and joint second place in the Singapore Malaysia Harp competition in 2010. Most recently, she was a soloist in Mozart’s Flute and Harp Concerto with the Musicians Initiative (Singapore), and Ravel’s Introduction and Allegro at the Singapore International Festival of Music in 2015. Charity has also taken part in festivals across the world including the Aspen Music Festival (Colorado, USA), Bowdoin International Music Festival (Maine, USA), Camac Harp Festival (Ancenis, France), and the Asian Harp Festival (Hong Kong). She is also a regular harpist at the triennial Singapore Harp Festival organised by Raveharps Singapore.

  

Charity began her harp studies with Katryna Tan and has since pursued a prolific education in harp performance. She was valedictorian and winner of the prestigious Lee Kwan Yew Gold medal award at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (National University of Singapore). She then proceeded to New York City to obtain her master’s degree at the Manhattan School of Music with the aid of the Hamish Dyer Young Musicians’ Scholarship and Trailblazer General Fund. Most recently, she received her second master’s degree from the esteemed Universität der Künste in Berlin. Charity’s teachers throughout the years include Marie-Pierre Langlamet (Berlin Philharmonic), Mariko Anraku (Metropolitan Opera), and Gulnara Mashurova (Singapore Symphony Orchestra).

  

Charity has a passion for growing and pushing the boundaries of the music scene in Singapore. An advocate of music education, she aims to bring about the realisation that the arts is a beautiful and essential part of every human being’s life. She has mentored youth orchestras including the Nanjing Youth Symphony Orchestra (Jiangsu, China), Penang Philharmonic Orchestra (Malaysia) and the Orchestra of the Music Makers (Singapore).
