Jolenta Wong graduated from the National University of Singapore with a double major in Life Sciences (Biology) and History. She then pursued her Masterâ€™s degree in Comparative and Public History at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, before going on to complete her Postgraduate Diploma in Education with the National Institute of Education (NIE).  
  
Jolenta taught History and Social Studies to students at the secondary level, and enjoyed journeying with her students as they grew in both stature and values. She then spent another two years at the Ministry of Education Headquarters before joining SOTA.  
  
Jolenta firmly believes in the complementary natures of the different disciplines, and the importance of Humanities as part of a holistic education for the whole person. As a flautist, she has been part of school symphonic bands over the years, and greatly cherished the camaraderie borne from band practices and stage experiences. She enjoys dancing and reading, and will never say no to a good cup of iced&nbsp;_tehsi_.
