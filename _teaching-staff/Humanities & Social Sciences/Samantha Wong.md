Samantha graduated from the University of Warwick with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in History and Politics. She then went on to pursue a Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. Samantha has undergone International Baccalaureate's specialised training in teaching History and in guiding students for their Extended Essays.

  

Samantha’s journey as an educator began at Meridian Junior College where she taught History and Project Work. She was also actively involved in the Students’ Council as one of its teacher mentors. A passionate educator, Samantha draws inspiration from all that is around her so as to imbue her students with a love for History and for learning. She served as a Subject Head for History from 2011 to 2012, and was placed on MOE’s Future Leaders Programme from 2010-2012. She took a hiatus thereafter to help set up a Foundation for the Singapore Business Federation.

  

Beyond the classroom, Samantha enjoys painting, travelling, yoga, coffee and golf.
