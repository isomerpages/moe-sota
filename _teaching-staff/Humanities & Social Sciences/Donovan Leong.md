Donovan Leong graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Social Sciences degree in Geography. He then attained a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore.

As a teacher, Donovan has taught Geography and Mathematics to students from the Express and Normal education streams. He has journeyed with many graduating batches of students from secondary school with good grades and witnessed their transformation into a more mature person imbued with sound values. Being a firm believer of Humanities education, he imparts important skills and knowledge to students. He not only teaches Geography, but also engages them in discussions about pertinent world issues, which allows them to discover the world using their geographical lenses. It is important to empower the students to be reflective practitioners and to be the innovative solutions of tomorrow.

Outside of the classroom, Donovan enjoys travelling, running marathons and engaging in volunteering work. As part of his university exchange programme, he spent a semester abroad in Grenoble, France and is fluent in the French language. He has also represented Singapore at a youth Francophone dialogue on human rights issues in Paris in 2014.
