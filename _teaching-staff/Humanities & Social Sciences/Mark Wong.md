Mark graduated from the University of Queensland with a double degree in Journalism and Arts (majoring in history) in 2004, and received his Honours in History a year later. He later continued his academic pursuit at the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore and completed his Postgraduate Diploma in Education in 2007. He has also undergone International Baccaulaureate's specialised training in teaching History and in guiding students for their Extended Essays.

  

Mark began his teaching career at Serangoon Junior College in 2007 and has contributed to the continuous good performance of the history cohort at the 'A' levels. He has also been recognised often by the school as one of the more caring teachers.

  

Mark was quite active in the arts during his formative years, being involved in the symphonic band during his secondary and polytechnic days. He also took part in inter-school exchanges and performed in overseas exchange programs in Hong Kong.
