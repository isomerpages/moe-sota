Nanthini graduated from the Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and embarked on her teaching career after completing her Postgraduate Diploma in Education with the National Institute of Education.  

  
She spent 6 years teaching English Language and Literature in secondary schools where she also served as level coordinator for both subjects, before her passion for Literature spurred her on to pursue a Masters in Science in Literature and Modernity from the University of Edinburgh.  
  
Nanthini has been a floorball enthusiast since her days as a student and continues to keep herself active by playing in a Singapore Floorball League Division 2 team. She is an avid runner, mostly enjoying long runs, and an equally keen reader. During the holidays, she dedicates her time to traveling abroad, preferring long, scenic drives through coastal and alpine roads, and trekking through rural landscapes.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
Nanthini is a passionate advocate of the Languages as well as the Arts which she strongly believes have the capacity to nurture sensitivity, sophistication and grit. It is this belief that has driven her to become a part of the community at SOTA where she hopes to provide students with the comfort and support that is quintessential to their growth as confident and exemplary members of society.
