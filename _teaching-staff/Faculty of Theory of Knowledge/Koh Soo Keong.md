Soo Keong holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Language and Philosophy. He is also a Philosophy Honours graduate from the National University of Singapore. Having served as an educator for the last 13 years, Soo Keong has taught in schools offering ‘O’ Level, Integrated Programme (IP) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) programmes. Prior to joining SOTA, Soo Keong served as the Deputy Dean for Theory of Knowledge in ACS (Independent), spearheading many programmes and initiatives.  
  
Soo Keong joined SOTA because he believes the true meaning of life lies in the arts and he wants to work with both the gifted and talented in SOTA. He loves long hikes, diving and keeping freshwater aquaria. He believes, too, that the questions are more important than their answers. He is addicted to coffee and kisses from his daughter.
