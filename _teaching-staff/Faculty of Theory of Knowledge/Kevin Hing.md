It was in the National University of Singapore (NUS) that Kevin first fell in love with the study of language, in particular its role in society. He was fascinated by the way language is used to convey, shape and change ideas and behaviours. Kevin pursued his love for linguistics in NUS, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English Language(EL) Studies (Hons). He also won the Minerva Prize for being the top EL Honours student of his cohort. After graduating from NIE, he has since completed his Masters in Language Studies with NUS.

  

Prior to joining SOTA, Kevin started teaching General Paper and Project Work in Meridian Junior College, where he was the Project Work Coordinator. He then took on the role of Subject Head for English Language and Linguistics in River Valley High School (RVHS), teaching English Language Arts, GP and English Language and Linguistics in the RVHS Integrated Programme. Kevin then joined Tanjong Katong Secondary School as Subject Head English Language and taught graduating classes in English for the "O" levels. Kevin's work in various educational institutions and curriculums has given him a wealth of valuable experiences and pedagogical skills, which he hopes can enhance the learning of his students.

  

For Kevin, learning is rooted in real life and he strives to make everyday experiences and current affairs relevant for students. For him, the arts embodies the best endeavours of human creativity and excellence, which is why he believes that the SOTA journey will be a meaningful and fulfilling one.

  

In his free time, Kevin dabbles in electronic dance music and was a finalist at the Juice DJ Competition finals at Zouk. His other pastimes include movies, reading and museum trips with his family. He delights in new experiences, but is also a nostalgic at heart. He believes that teaching is a lifelong calling, and is proud to be called a teacher.
