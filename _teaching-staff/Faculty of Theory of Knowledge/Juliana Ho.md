Juliana began her teaching career with a Diploma in Physical Education (1989) before obtaining a Bachelor of Arts (English Language &amp; Literature) in 1997 and a Master of Education (English Language) from Nanyang Technological University in 2009. She also earned a Diploma in Departmental Management in 2005 and was conferred the National Day Award (Efficiency Medal) by the Ministry of Education that year for her significant contributions to the school.  
  
She has almost 26 years of experience in education, having taught in schools offering ‘O’ Level, ‘A’ Level and Integrated programmes. As a level coordinator in her last school, she presented a paper on&nbsp;_Teaching Critical Reflective Writing_&nbsp;at her cluster schools' symposium and conducted a staff professional workshop on cross-disciplinary literacy as a champion for Whole-School Approach to Effective Communication. She is also a Google Certified Educator Level 2 and a strong advocate of integrating IT into her lessons to engage her students meaningfully and to facilitate self-directed learning.  

As an educator, Juliana adopts a growth mindset and embraces change and sees it as an opportunity to step out of her comfort zone. While some may regard change with trepidation, she welcomes the moment to re-learn and learn to develop herself professionally and personally. Therefore, it is no wonder that her motto in life is ‘if it is to be, it is up to me’ and this proactive attitude towards learning is something she strives to inculcate in her students as a survival skill.  
  
Beyond school, she is passionate about spending time with her close-knit family and runs regularly for the sole purpose of enjoying her travels overseas.
