William Davies is from the United Kingdom and graduated from the University of Wales Swansea with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Economics and Politics. His passion for politics and current affairs led him to continue his studies at the University of Essex, where he obtained a Masters in Politics. William then worked for six years in English local government, before returning to full time study and obtained a Post-Graduate Certificate in Education at Canterbury Christ Church University.

  

William began his teaching career in the United Kingdom where he taught Humanities at a secondary school in Sheerness, a coastal town in the south of England. It was William’s developing interest in the humanities that led him to teach overseas, first in Nepal, then Sudan and now Singapore which has enabled him to immerse himself in alternative cultures and develop an international perspective to education.

  

William was appointed by the Ministry of Education in 2013 and spent six years teaching General Paper and Project Work ‘A’ Level at Tampines Junior College. William was also teacher-in-charge of the College Debate Club and took pride in seeing his students grow into mature and articulate debaters under his tutelage.

  

William is a passionate advocate critical thinking in the classroom and encourages students to develop questions which allow them take control of their own learning. He believes this also creates a ‘citizenship ethos’ in the classroom, where the opinion of every student is valued.
