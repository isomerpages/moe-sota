Siew Heng received her Bachelor of Arts (majoring in English Language and English Literature) from the National University of Singapore and Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. She has also undergone International Baccalaureate’s specialised training in teaching Theory of Knowledge.

  

Prior to joining SOTA, Siew Heng taught English Language and English Literature in mainstream secondary schools. She has served as subject coordinator in various schools as well as Head of Department at Kranji Secondary School.

  

A firm believer that the arts play a critical role in the development of the whole child, Siew Heng has been involved in various arts activities outside the curriculum. She was part of the organising committee for the Cluster Racial Harmony Day Celebration Concert at the Indoor Stadium when Kranji Secondary School was the organising school.

She was also in the steering committee when Greenridge Secondary School produced its first in-house musical for the school’s 40th anniversary celebration, with His Excellency, Mr S. R. Nathan, the President of the Republic of Singapore, as the Guest of Honour.

  
Siew Heng has always been fascinated by how knowledge can be deeply profound and abstract, yet relevant to all that is happening around us. She hopes to bring this to the classroom and enthuse her students to be eager and engaged learners and thinkers.
