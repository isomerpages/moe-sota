A Canadian raised in Hong Kong and Toronto, Charis Lo graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) as a Psychology Specialist. She also holds a Bachelor of Education from the Ontario Institute of Studies In Education. She has also undergone International Baccalaureate’s specialised training in teaching Theory of Knowledge and Approaches to Learning.  
  
Charis' unique cultural experience has given her the opportunity to work with a variety of students and families from different backgrounds, in both Eastern and Western communities. Selected by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) to teach while she was in Toronto, Charis began her teaching stint in Singapore in 2009. She has worked in mainstream schools teaching the ‘A’ Level Curriculum, and also sparked interest and spearheaded what is now the Model United Nations community at her previous school.  
  
Previously, Charis had also taught students who were undertaking the Ontario High School Diploma and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in Toronto.  
  
Before her teaching career, Charis had the privilege of helping and serving her community as a counsellor for the Toronto Distress Centre. She enjoys serving her community and is currently involved in helping the local animal shelter.  
  
Charis thoroughly enjoys teaching abroad and has been bitten by the travel bug since arriving in Singapore. She likes exploring her surroundings, and has a newly found love for cycling. She believes that the journey one takes is more important than the destination one arrives at, and hopes to enrich and be enriched on her journey here at SOTA.
