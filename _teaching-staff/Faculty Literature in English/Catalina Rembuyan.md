Catalina has taught the English language and literature to students at the secondary and pre-university level of education across various international curricula for more than 10 years, covering the International Baccalaureate (IB), the Cambridge and GCE A-Levels, as well as Key Stage 3 for the British national syllabus. A graduate of Malaysiaâ€™s oldest and only English department specialising fully in the study of literature, Catalina wrote her M.A. thesis to the study of Southeast Asian poet Wong Phui Nam before embarking on a career in teaching secondary and pre-university students.

  

A believer of experiential education and the application of literary knowledge to practice, Catalina has played an active role in training and developing students through both student theatre and youth journalism. She has led and assisted in the production of full-length theatre productions of plays by Neil Simon, Tom Stoppard, John Cariani and David Ives, with genres ranging from family dramas to interactive drawing room mysteries.

  

Working with the religious organisation Scripture Union, Catalina has spent several years training young journalists through its youth magazine,&nbsp;_Phases_&nbsp;and its spin-off project the Young Writers Camp. She has also served as advisor to college campus magazines and volunteered for The Pixel Project, a US-based initiative to raise awareness on violence against women through social media.

  

A spoken word poet and a published author, Catalina has performed poetry at various events in Kuala Lumpur, including at cross-causeway poetry slams involving poets from both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Her fiction, poetry and essays have been published in both Malaysia and Singapore, including the anthology of Southeast Asian urban fiction&nbsp;_HEAT_&nbsp;and a compilation of essays from Christian Asian writers published by Graceworks,&nbsp;_Twelve Strands: Journeys with Asian Authors_. She is the editor of two editions of the literary journal&nbsp;_Little Basket: New Malaysian Writing_&nbsp;and has written for Singaporean youth magazines such as&nbsp;_Breadbits_,&nbsp;_Montage_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_Vita_&nbsp;published by Asiapac. Anthologies featuring her works have been exhibited at the London, Frankfurt and Tokyo International Book Fair.
