Melissa majored in both English Literature and Sociology at the National University of Singapore. She graduated in 2003 with Second Class (Upper) Honours in English Literature. Having aspired to teach since she was a teenager, she completed a Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education and joined Nanyang Junior College in 2004, where she taught English Literature. Believing that learning experiences should be an on-going process, she took a year off in 2008/2009 to complete her Masters Degree in Colonial and Postcolonial Cultures at the University of Sussex, UK, and spent much of her time in the London theatres and travelling through Europe. She has also undergone International Baccaulaureate's specialised training in guiding students for their Creativity, Activity, Service projects.

  

Melissa possesses a great love for the literary arts. Literature is, for her, the appreciation of humanity’s imagination and creative soul, and she constantly works to inspire her students to believe similarly.

  

She also has a passion for drama, and believes in the power of theatre to impact young lives. During her stint at Nanyang Junior College, Melissa worked with the college’s Drama Club to produce the annual Drama Night, promoted theatrical appreciation among her students, and created opportunities for her students to meet and interact with theatre professionals such as Sir Ian McKellen and Kevin Spacey.

  

Firm in the belief that one must live full lives and inspire others to do the same, Melissa is always on the lookout for opportunities for adventure and sharing. Some of the adventures that she hopes to complete include embarking on the Camino de Santiago, and to perform in a Shakespearean play.
