Soumya Poduval has a Bachelor’s degree in English Literature from Stella Maris College, Chennai, and a Master’s in Modern and Contemporary Literature from the University of York, United Kingdom. She worked briefly in the publishing industry before going on to pursue a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education, Singapore.  
  
Before coming to SOTA, Soumya taught English Literature and the General Paper for several years at Anderson Junior College and Anderson-Serangoon Junior College, where she also supported the school’s drama club, humanities programme, and student participation in Model United Nations conferences.  
  
Soumya hopes for her classrooms to be spaces for the cultivation of curiosity, compassion and openness. She learns from her students every day.  
  
Outside of the classroom, Soumya likes animals, sweet treats and long walks, and tries to combine these interests where possible.
