Colin first fell in love with Literature when he was a student at Raffles Junior College. He relished the opportunity to analyse novels and short stories, particularly enjoying class debates about characters and themes. Colin went on to pursue a Bachelor of Communication Studies (Honours) degree, graduating with a Major in Journalism &amp; Publishing, as well as a Minor in Drama &amp; Performance.

Trained at the National Institute of Education, Colin has taught English and English Literature at River Valley High School and Yuhua Secondary School. For four consecutive years, Colin was a Subject Level Coordinator and a teacher-in-charge for the award-winning Dance Society in River Valley. At Yuhua Secondary, Colin was the Subject Head of the English Department and the Head of Corporate Communications, roles which allowed him to oversee a wide range of academic programmes, editorial publications and outreach efforts. Both schools have given him valuable experience in teaching for the Integrated Programme and GCE 'O' Levels, equipping him with skills to tailor pedagogies for students of varying abilities.

Prior to joining the Ministry of Education, Colin was Editor at JobsCentral Group, where he was in charge of editorial publications and content resources for tertiary students and jobseekers. This included the widely circulated BrightSparks magazine and JobsCentral Community, an online portal featuring articles, research surveys and forums.

In his free time, Colin enjoys reading, pop music and hitting the gym. Colin has also contributed significantly to the arts scene in Singapore. For 12 years, he was the vocalist and lyricist of indie rock band King Kong Jane. The band rose to prominence after performing at the Esplanade's Baybeats music festival, and was once named Best English Local Act in The Sunday Times. King Kong Jane performed extensively, for events such as the Singapore Arts Festival, Mosaic Music Festival and Youth Olympic Games. Its debut album Waiting For Friday was released to critical acclaim in 2011, with the title track receiving frequent airplay on radio station Lush 99.5FM.

Colin is a passionate educator who believes in harnessing the power of language to inform and inspire. He believes that every student has the potential to appreciate and excel in Literature, and that the subject will help students to better understand themselves and the world they live in today.
