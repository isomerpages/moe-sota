A compulsive under-the-blankets reader in childhood, Prasatt has always been fascinated by words. This fascination was brought into relief in school where he discovered the subject of Literature and its power to unlock the secrets contained in his beloved books. It was then only natural that he pursued a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in English Literature at the National University of Singapore. He is also a graduate of the University Scholars Programme, a highly-selective multidisciplinary programme. Prasatt was also one of five students selected for the prestigious Yale Visiting International Student Programme, during which he spent a year at Yale as a junior. Driven by his thirst for learning, Prasatt not only graduated with First Class Honours, he was also placed on various honour rolls including the Dean’s List, Senior Honour Roll and President’s Honour Roll.

  

Wanting to share and spread his love for words, Prasatt joined teaching. Having taught in private and government schools, Prasatt then went on to complete his Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University. He continues to be fuelled by his curiosity, love for multidisciplinary learning and responsibility toward his students’ long-term flourishing at SOTA. Here, Prasatt has the opportunity to draw from various art forms to deepen the learning of his talented charges. He remains excited about the ability of Literature to broaden perspectives, develop critical thinking and nurture empathy in the young.

  

Prasatt has a passion for writing and has been mentored by esteemed local and international poets alike such as Edwin Thumboo, Shirley Geok-Lin Lim, Jay Barnard and Louise Gluck. His writing has been published in poetry anthologies such as&nbsp;_Red Pulse_,&nbsp;_Red Pulse II_&nbsp;and&nbsp;_Little Things: An Anthology of Poetry_.

  

Beyond the literary, Prasatt also loves taking long hikes surrounded by nature in places like Nepal, Tibet and Burma. Most recently, he was the first Singaporean to complete the gruelling 4,280 km- long Pacific Crest Trail in the US, raising over $100,000 for charity in the process.
