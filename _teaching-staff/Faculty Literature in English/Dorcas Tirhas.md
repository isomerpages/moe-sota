Dorcas Tirhas graduated with an Honours Degree in English Literature from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2004. Her interests also extend to sports, and she was captain of the Ladies Varsity Floorball Team.  
  
In 2005, Dorcas went to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland where she received her Post Graduate Certificate in Education. She is registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland and, while there, taught English Language and Literature. She established links between Scottish and Singaporean students as she believes very strongly that the modern student must be aware of and learn how to negotiate cross-cultural terrains.  
  
Dorcas has also undergone International Baccalaureate's specialised training in teaching English Language and Literature, and in guiding students for the Extended Essay.  
  
Exposure to different countries and systems of education - from growing up in Africa, to studying and teaching in Singapore and Scotland - has given Dorcas an appreciation and respect for World Literature; particularly poetry, which allows students to access their own and other cultures.
