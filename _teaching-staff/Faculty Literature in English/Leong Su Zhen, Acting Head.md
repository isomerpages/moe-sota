Leong Su Zhen holds a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE). Prior to coming to SOTA, Su Zhen was a Curriculum Planning Officer at the Ministry of Education Headquarters. She has also previously taught English Language and Literature at Deyi Secondary School.


Su Zhen strongly believes that Literature allows readers to see the world from different perspectives. She hopes that students will be able to develop empathy and understanding through reading and writing.


Outside of the classroom, Su Zhen enjoys writing creatively. She has been published in various poetry anthologies, most recently in A Luxury We Must Afford (2017) by Math Paper Press.
