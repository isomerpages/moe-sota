Kania Arini Sukotjo graduated from the Academy of Art University, U.S.A with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Animation and Visual Effects. She then received a Master's degree in Media Design from Keio University, Japan, and a Ph.D. in Comparative Asian Studies from the National University of Singapore.&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

After completing her Bachelor's degree, Kania took the opportunity to become an animator for a feature film called 'Tatsumi', directed by Eric Khoo. After which, she joined a production house called Film Magik, as an assistant producer and storyboard artist, which enabled her to participate in several TVC projects for well-known products and companies such as, Panasonic, Guardian, CPF, Kronenbourg, and Chivas.  

After curating a diverse portfolio in the media industry, Kania decided to pursue a career in academic research which stems from the time she spent for her Master's degree in Japan. She was part of a research project that studied Indonesian consumption culture on media for 'Hakuhodo'. Furthermore, Kania had participated in various academic workshops and presented papers at conferences in U.S.A, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and Korea.&nbsp;  

With enough international exposure to various facets of academia, Kania began specialising in becoming an educator. In the recent years, she moved back to Singapore to pursue a Ph.D. degree. Meanwhile, she became a teaching assistant in the areas of Japanese cinema and popular culture to tertiary students at NUS for 5 years. Upon completion of her Ph.D., she became a lecturer at Lasalle College of the Arts for 3 years, teaching Film History, Critical Thinking, and Production Analysis to both diploma and bachelor's students.&nbsp;  

&nbsp;

Besides her professional pursuits, Kania enjoys sketching, writing, and reading during her spare time. As an ode to her background and passion for animation, she continues to fine tune her skill as an animator and storyboard artist.
