David Cheng is a Law graduate who decided to pursue his lifelong interest in media and its visual forms. He first cut his teeth at Malaysia’s first independent broadcaster, TV3 Malaysia, which includes Cyberwave, the first technology show in the region that looks at the nascent Internet and its technology. He then embarked on a stint with the then newly formed Singapore-based Channel NewsAsia and continued to produce various technology and current affairs television programmes. His last project before leaving the broadcaster is That’s IT, an insight into the dysfunctional phenomenon arising from Asia’s fascination and obsession with gadgets, gizmos, and all things geeky.

In 2005, with an accumulated nine years of TV experiences, David joined Republic Polytechnic’s newly established School of Technology for the Arts as a teaching staff for Visual and Media modules. In his six years at Republic Polytechnic, he also produced videos for the school and supervised industry collaborations and final year projects.

At SOTA, David shares his industry and teaching experiences to explore visual narrative through the use various media forms. He has also undergone International Baccalaureate’s specialised training in teaching Film, Theory of Knowledge, Approaches to Learning and in guiding students for their Extended Essays. He believes that we can all relate to each other through visual stories and that films and videos are a “visual document” of our diaspora society, to showcase one’s experiences as well as social conditioning.
