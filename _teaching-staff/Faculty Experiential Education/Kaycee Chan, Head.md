Kaycee Chan graduated from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a Bachelor’s Degree majoring in Physical Education (PE) and Physics. He went on to pursue the Master of Philosophy at the University of Queensland under the Ministry of Education’s Postgraduate Scholarship and subsequently attained the Doctor of Philosophy in the area of Sport Pedagogy. He has also completed the Management and Leadership in Schools Programme conducted by the National Institute of Education (NIE).  
  
Kaycee has more than 20 years of experience in education. In the span of his career, he has held the positions of Subject Head of PE, Head of Department of PE and Co-Curricular Activities as well as Curriculum Planning Officer at the Physical and Sports Education Branch, Ministry of Education.  
  
He was one of the curriculum writers for the Physical Education Teaching and Learning Syllabus (2014) and played an active role in the review of assessment in PE. Kaycee was the lead secretariat for the review of the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) in 2013. This led to a policy change in the conduct of NAPFA test at the primary, secondary and pre- university levels, among other important initiatives to enhance the quality of teaching and learning of PE in schools.
