Michelle Lek graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with an Honours Degree in Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Psychology. She went on to pursue a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Physical Education and Mathematics) at the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore.

  

Michelle taught Physical Education (PE) at Temasek Junior College from 2009 to 2011. She subsequently went on to teach PE at Raffles Girlsâ€™ School (RGS) from mid-2011 to 2022. She is an experienced PE teacher who has an extensive background in sports, especially in badminton.

  

Michelle was a former National Badminton player and has served as the main Teacher-in-charge and assistant coach for the school team in RGS from 2013 to 2020. She has a strong passion for the sport and has represented all her schools at all levels and has also represented Singapore in badminton competitions. She has been awarded various awards such as the Sports Council Colours Awards, and has also been on the coaching and selection panel for the Singapore Schools Badminton Team, even accompanying them as the Accompanying Female Coach for the 3rd, 6th and 7th Asian Schools Championships in 2011, 2015 and 2018 respectively.

  

Michelle believes that experiential education through sports allows a person to build character and pick up skills, values and attitudes required to succeed in life that cannot be learnt in the classroom. She also believes that the knowledge, camaraderie and bonds forged through experiential learning in Physical Education will set a person up to be an active and healthy individual for life.
