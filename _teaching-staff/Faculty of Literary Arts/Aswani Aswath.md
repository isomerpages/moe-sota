Aswani Aswath graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in English Literature and a minor in Theatre Studies. She holds a Masters of Arts (Distinction) in Creative Writing from Goldsmiths, University of London.  
  
Aswani has been teaching English Language to primary and secondary school students over the past 6 years and specialises in Creative Writing. Through an engaged pedagogy, she steers her students to acquire writing, speaking and critical thinking skills for lifelong learning. She also empowers her students to tap into their individual writer’s voice to help them articulate their unique perspectives about the world and build deeper relationships with the community.  
  
On top of teaching, Aswani continues her own artistic journey as a playwright and theatre practitioner. As a Writer-in-Residence for Buds Theatre Company, she wrote scripts for schools and community-based projects and conducted playwriting workshops for the youth theatre wing. Her plays have also been performed at various festivals by the Esplanade, the Arts House, Wild Rice, T:&gt;works and Ravindran Drama Group amongst others. Most recently, she completed the Playwrights’ Cove mentorship programme organised by The Necessary Stage under the tutelage of Haresh Sharma.  
  
Besides theatre, Aswani has also presented her poetry at the Singapore Writers Festival and Georgetown Literary Festival. Passionate about diversity in storytelling, Aswani invests in shedding light on social issues that affect marginalised communities. At SOTA, she aims to inspire students to harness the craft of writing and become effective communicators, creators and changemakers in their own stead.
