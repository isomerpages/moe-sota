Tan Cheng Hung has a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Linguistics from the National University of Singapore (NUS), a Graduate Diploma in Education from Institute of Education Singapore and a Masters of Creative Arts in Theatre Directing and Creative Writing from University of Wollongong Australia.

  

Cheng Hung has taught students aged 5 to 30 and developed curriculum for different types of schools. At the start of her teaching career, Cheng Hung worked in two Gifted Education Programme schools: Raﬄes Girls' Secondary School and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). At Julia Gabriel Centre, she taught and designed programmes for Written Language Arts, Speech and Drama and The Friday Club (an integrated theatre and creative writing class for teenagers). At tertiary level, she taught and designed courses for Creative Writing, Theatre, Speculative Fiction, Mythology and Creative Thinking in schools which include LaSalle College Of The Arts, Temasek Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic.

  

As a theatre practitioner, Cheng Hung has worked as director, playwright, actor, producer, designer and taught theatre skills to children, teenagers and adults. She trained in physical theatre with the late William Teo and worked with his theatre company Asia In Theatre Research Centre from 1995 to 2000, focusing on directing, script-writing, acting, ensemble work and improvisation. From 2002 to 2006, she was Co-Artistic Director of Buds Youth Theatre (based at The Substation), where she volunteered her time and experience by directing and producing plays, conducting regular training in acting, improvisation and production management.

  

Cheng Hung enjoys stories in many forms and mediums: contemporary and speculative ﬁction, experimental ﬁction, ﬁlm, visual art, theatre, contemporary dance and mixed media stories. She has written short stories, plays and creative non ﬁction. Two of her plays have been staged in Singapore.

  

Cheng Hung brings her wide ranging interests in the arts into the classroom to help her students appreciate the process of observing, imagining, creating and self expression. Always curious, she continues to explore the craft of writing and the search for more stories.
