Zachary is an actor and theatre educator. He holds a Bachelor of Arts from the National University of Singapore for Theatre Studies and English Literature. He is also a graduate of the Intercultural Theatre Institute (formerly Theatre Training &amp; Research Programme), a full-time 3 year acting programme founded by the late Kuo Pao Kun, which is predicated on exposing the actor to both traditional sensibilities and contemporary practices.

  

Zachary is happy to contribute to theatre in Singapore. Having taught in schools and various institutions for seven years, he continues to challenge the youth of Singapore to find their voice, and use it.
