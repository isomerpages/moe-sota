Marianne read English Literature and Sociology at the National University of Singapore. She went on to the National Institute of Education (NIE) to obtain a Diploma in Education to enable her to share her love for Literature with youths. In 2006, she graduated with an Advanced Postgraduate Diploma in Drama and Drama Education from NIE. Since then, she bravely entered into the world of Drama and has never looked back. She taught Foundation Drama and GCSE ‘O’ Level Drama for seven years and enjoyed every moment of it.  
  
Not satisfied with just being a teacher, Marianne has tried her hand in directing and performing short pieces. Under the umbrella of Singapore Drama Educator's Association, she has collaborated with artists and worked with teachers and students to devise a piece for Celebrate Drama in 2012 and 2013. She hopes to continue working with youths to create and make theatre.
