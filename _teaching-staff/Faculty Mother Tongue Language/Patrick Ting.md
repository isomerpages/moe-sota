Patrick received his Bachelor of Arts (Degree) in Chinese Studies from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Chinese Language) from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore.

  

Before joining SOTA, Patrick was a teacher in Nanyang Girls' High School. Throughout his teaching years in the school, he worked with Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) to conduct creative writing programmes via technology devices, online platforms and group work. Patrick also took charge of a few overseas trips to China for the Global Classroom Programme. These trips exposed students to different cultures and different learning environments, which helped them gain knowledge of other parts of the world.

  

Patrick enjoys writing and has published a book《蛋黄的杯盘狼藉》with Lingzi Media Pte Ltd in 2014. The book is about some encounters in life that have prompted him to think about life, love, parting and other issues. Apart from writing, Patrick has a deep passion for dance since his secondary school days. He is a member of NUS Dance Blast and is involved in dance productions. He hopes that his keen interest in the arts and his teaching experience can help SOTA students appreciate the Chinese language and find joy in learning it.
