Wu Jing holds a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Literature and Linguistics from Harbin Normal University, China, and a master’s degree in Management from Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom (UK).

  

Prior to joining SOTA, Wu Jing taught ‘O’ Level Higher Chinese, Express Chinese, and Chinese Culture for eight years at Maris Stella High School where she was also a level coordinator. In addition, she taught Chinese as a second/foreign language for one year in the UK following the HSK syllabus.

  

Beyond teaching, Wu Jing was teacher in charge of Maris Stella High School Chinese Orchestra (MSHSCO) Co-Curriculum Activity (CCA). MSHSCO achieved a Distinction Award at the Singapore Youth Festival and in 2014, together with the school’s Symphony Band, it performed at the Marist Arts Fiesta at the Esplanade Concert Hall.

  

Wu Jing also organised several immersion trips to China, as well as school activities including Chinese New Year celebration and Mother Tongue Fortnight.

  

Wu Jing strongly believes that students approach learning differently. In her teaching, she likes to use a variety of delivery methods to inspire students to familiarize themselves with the distinctive features of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

  

Outside of the classroom, Wu Jing enjoys outdoor activities and dancing. She has participated in dance performances including MediaCorp's Lunar New Year’s Eve Special 2019 opening performance and Inter Racial Inter Religious Harmony Nite (IRIRHN) 2018.
