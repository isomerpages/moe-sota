Guo Yixiu graduated with a Master of Philosophy in Arts Education from the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom in 2020. Her education has also seen her through Nanyang Junior College’s Art Elective Programme as well as Nanyang Technological University, Art, Design and Media School’s Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Photography and Digital Imaging.  
  
In art, Yixiu's interest in media ranges across drawing, painting and photography. She was an artist of the Singapore Biennale 2013, and has won awards in the International Photography Awards in the United States as well as the Kwek Leng Joo Photography Award in 2013. She has exhibited across a range of exhibitions both locally and internationally.  
  
In education, Yixiu's interest is in pedagogy design and curriculum development. She has worked with both public and private companies to produce collateral materials related to curriculum design. She has had 7 years of teaching experience, with curriculum experience in GCE-O level, A-level and adult learners (teacher workshops at the Singapore Teachers' Academy for the aRts in 2019 and 2020).  
  
Yixiu is on a continuous search for the ongoing links between practice (art) and pedagogy (education), engaging in the belief that art education is an integration of practice, knowledge, strategies, a reflection of lifelong learning and essential to life.
