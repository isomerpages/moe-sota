Zainudin graduated with a Master of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts (Distinction) from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, majoring in sculpture.

  

Working with installation, Zainudin’s practice enumerates the creative process through both draughtsmanship and physical forms. In 1997, he represented Singapore in the ASEAN Youth Sculpture Symposium in Brunei Darussalam. In 2003, he was an invited artist for the Hopea Sangal Tree Sculpture Symposium and the 1st Biennial Sculpture Symposium held in Singapore.

  
His involvement in the art industries began in 1994 and his commissioned public works can be found at historical sites in Singapore, including Raffles Institution and the Singapore Zoological Gardens. He was also commissioned by the Land Transport Authority of Singapore to install a permanent public artwork for one of the Downtown line MRT stations.

  

In 2005, Zainudin was the recipient for the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Art Award for excellent visual art practice. Since 1994, he has won several awards in art competitions and art consultancy.

  

He has more than 10 years of teaching experience and has taught in local art institutes, polytechnics, and universities, designing course syllabi that infuse fine art and product design aesthetic.
