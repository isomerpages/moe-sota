Keith Ang was a recipient of the Art Elective Scholarship and was later awarded the MOE teaching scholarship. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (Highest Honours) in Painting from Pratt Institute in 2014.  
  
Upon completion of his Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education, Keith had the opportunity to experience teaching Art in various Secondary schools. He was then posted to the Communications and Engagement Group in MOE HQ, where he was responsible for creating many of the COVID-19 related content for MOE’s social media platforms such as the Soaper 5. His stint at the HQ office allowed him to gain perspective into Singapore’s education landscape and learn about government communications.  
  
Before coming back to SOTA as a full time teacher, Keith was working as an Art Director for a local creative agency. Coupled with his past experience of being in the Band of Doodlers, he has expanded his repertoire of skills to include illustration and graphic design and has worked with clients such as Prudential, DBS, the National Museum of Singapore and 4Fingers.  
  
A firm believer in the value of art and how it is a catalyst for cultural enlightenment, Keith hopes to create a more inclusive and peaceful society through education and his personal artworks. He is always eager to learn new skills and to push himself to be a better artist and designer, a trait that he hopes to instil in his students as well.
