Lim Boon Eng received her Bachelor's of Fine Art and Art History at Goldsmiths College, University of London, in 1994 under the Public Service Commission Overseas Teaching Scholarship Award. She completed her MA Art History (Distinction) at School of Oriental and African Studies in 2013 under the Ministry of Education (MOE) Postgraduate Scholarship Award, and was awarded Merit Prize in the Open Category of the IBM Painting Award in 1990 and Merit Prize in the National Heritage Board Photography Competition Digital Category in 1997.  
  
Boon Eng pursues her artistic practices in media such as drawing, painting and photography, and has participated at art teachersâ€™ exhibitions and charity fundraising events. As an art history graduate, Boon Eng has interest in both Western and Oriental art, particularly in terms of the practices and the multiplicity of purpose that surround them. She believes that with a greater appreciation of this discipline, art-making as an on-going conversation with the past, present and future can be enriched.  
  
Boon Eng began her art education journey in 1995. She has diverse teaching experiences including the MOE Art Elective Programme, independent school and integrated programmes, and was also involved in curriculum design and planning at HQ level as well. She has taught batches of art students, many of whom have gone on to join the creative industries and some have become art educators. She frequently conducts sharing sessions with the art teaching fraternity on effective teaching approaches and professional learning including the 2015 Redesigning Pedagogy International Conference organised by the National Institute of Education. With 10 years of experience as a middle manager in schools, Boon Eng strongly believes in continual professional growth and teamwork.
