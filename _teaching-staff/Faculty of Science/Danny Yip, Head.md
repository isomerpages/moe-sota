Danny obtained a First Class Honours in Chemistry with a Minor in Economics from National University of Singapore (NUS). He was the recipient of the German Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) Award for his final year project. He completed his Postgraduate Diploma in Education and was later nominated to attend the Management and Leadership in Schools Programme at the National Institute of Education (NIE).

  

Before joining SOTA, Danny has taught in schools for more than 10 years. He was teaching the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and was subsequently appointed as Subject Head of Science at Xinmin Secondary School. He led for several years in the Assessment Committee as well as in school-based signature curricular programmes â€“ Applied Science and Analytical Thinking Skills. His involvement in the Student Council, Symphonic Band and Scholars Programme allowed him to play a role in nurturing student leaders.

  

Danny has shared pedagogical practices with school leaders, teachers and researchers at both local and international events. These include the 2012 Ministry of Education Excellence through Continuous Enterprise and Learning Fest (MOE ExCEL Fest) and the 2013 World Association of Lesson Studies (WALS) International Conference held in Gothenburg, Sweden.

  

Danny is excited to explore the connections between arts and science with his students. He draws inspiration from his travels and music-making experiences as a trombone player in school bands, community projects and in the Singapore Armed Forces Band.
