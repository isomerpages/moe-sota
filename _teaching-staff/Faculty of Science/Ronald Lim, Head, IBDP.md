Ronald graduated from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore with a Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering (Honours). He went on to obtain his Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore.

  

Ronald taught ‘A’ level Physics at National Junior College (NJC) from 2000 to 2003, where he was one of the teachers-in-charge of NJC’s symphonic band. Thereafter he became one of the pioneer teachers of Anglo-Chinese School (International) when it started in 2005. He helped to build resources for the effective teaching of Physics, and taught both Cambridge International Examinations ‘A’ level and International Baccalaureate Physics. He was appointed as teacher-in-charge of the Student Council to develop students’ leadership potential, and was also the Lead Tutor for Year 5 &amp; 6 students, where he looked into the developmental and pastoral needs of senior students.

During his school days, Ronald played the trombone at The Chinese High School Military Band and Raffles Junior College Concert Band. He also performed with the NIE Symphonic Band in their annual concert. Ronald has a passion to develop students holistically, with an emphasis on character building and their ability to have a cohesive understanding of their society and physical world. He finds that Physics is the best medium to do so as this subject touches almost every aspect of life.
