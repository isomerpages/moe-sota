Yuet Lai’s passion for teaching began at a young age, when she was awarded a Teaching Scholarship with the Public Service Commission (PSC) straight after completing her A-Levels. Subsequently, she received a Bachelor of Science Degree with Honours (2nd Upper) in 2002, and a Master of Science Degree in 2003 from the National University of Singapore. After completing her Postgraduate Diploma in Education at the National Institute of Education (NIE), Yuet Lai went on to teach the A-Level curriculum at Innova Junior College. As part of her professional development, she was selected by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to participate in the Overseas Teacher Attachment Programme at Cornell University.

  

Her years of teaching experience have enabled her to develop pedagogies catered to the learning needs of students. With a firm belief in experiential learning, she continues to explore inquiry-based methods and connections between art and science.

  

During her free time, she enjoys a cup of coffee at boutique cafés. Other times, she loves to spend precious family time with her two bubbly kids.
