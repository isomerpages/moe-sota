Renee earned her Bachelor of Science degree in General Biology with a minor in Management of Information Technology from the National University of Singapore. Inspired to join the teaching fraternity, she went on to the National Institute of Education and obtained her Postgraduate Diploma in Education for the teaching of Secondary Biology and Chemistry. She has also undergone International Baccalaureateâ€™s specialised training in teaching Biology.

  

Renee began her teaching career with a short stint in Queensway Secondary School before she was posted to Pioneer Junior College, where she taught for 11 years. Renee had various opportunities to mentor new teachers in her capacity as a senior teacher. She was also the cooperating teacher and accessor for NIE trainees. As the coordinator of Professional Development, Renee also facilitated professional sharing of good practices and assisted in streamlining and adapting new pedagogies to train teachers in her department.

  

In 2008, Renee was selected by the Ministry of Education for an Overseas Attachment Programme to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. She participated in the 3-week Educator Summer Programme and benefitted immensely from the sharing sessions with educators from different parts of the world. Renee was also appointed as the college Deputy Head of Internal Examinations for eight years, where she led a team of teachers in the administration and running of school examinations.

  

A believer of authentic learning, Renee seeks opportunities to infuse real-life examples, case studies, simple experiments or demonstrations in her lessons. She enjoys engaging students with hands-on activities and encourages them to question, discuss and reflect on their learning. Renee believes Biology is relevant in all aspects of life, including the Arts, and aims to help her students make the connections.
