Aida attained her Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in Chemistry, from the National University of Singapore, and her Postgraduate Diploma in Education as well as a Masters in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. She has also undergone International Baccalaureateâ€™s specialised training in teaching Chemistry.

  

Aida taught Chemistry at Maris Stella High School from 2001-2009. She believes that every child is unique and their true learning potential can be realised through differentiated instructions. This is evident in the value-added academic performance of the graduating classes she taught.

  

She has also presented research papers at local and international conferences. In 2005, she presented at the Centre for Research and Pedagogy (CRPP) of NIE, as well as at Ministry of Education (MOE) ExcelFest and North Zone Symposium on Information and Technology.

  

Aida enjoys going for musicals, dance and theatre performances in her leisure time. Her visits to numerous art museums and galleries worldwide affirm her belief that art and science can coexist. Aida is keen to integrate both disciplines in her teaching to create a holistic learning experience for all her students.
