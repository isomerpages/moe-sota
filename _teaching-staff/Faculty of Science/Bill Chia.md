Bill Chia received the Public Service Commission (PSC) Teaching Scholarship (Local) from the Ministry of Education (MOE), and graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Science Honours (2nd Upper), followed by a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Physical Education) from NIE. He started his teaching career in 1999 at Ngee Ann Secondary School, followed by Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and Hwa Chong International, and then SOTA in 2019.

  

In his 20 years of teaching, Bill has taught the entire spectrum of students with different learning needs and capabilities, spanning across the Normal Technical, Normal Academic, Express, and Gifted Education Program streams. In 2015, he adjusted his career path and left MOE to embark on his journey as an IBDP teacher. In the last decade, he has also been appointed as an Examiner for Chemistry as well as Extended Essay for the IBDP examination.

  

Bill is an ardent supporter of the theatre; in particular, he enjoys Chinese plays from local and Taiwanese theatre groups. Other than Theatre, Bill also enjoys watching films by independent directors. He feels that both the theatre and films are effective platforms where social issues can be raised and the audience, through performances, is afforded a space to reflect on the issues raised. Bill is also an avid reader, his favorite genres being Chinese prose and travelogues. During weekends, Bill would usually be busy in the kitchen as he enjoys cooking up a storm for his families and friends. Another passion of his would be travelling to far flung places to experience alternative ways of living.

  

As a teacher, Bill hopes to imbue in his students that in all of lifeâ€™s pursuits, the journey usually matters more than the destination. In particular, he hopes his students will not be caught up in achieving academic targets so much that they overlook the joy and fulfillment of the learning process.
