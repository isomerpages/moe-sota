Kumutha graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree (majoring in Biology) from the National University of Singapore and went on to receive her Postgraduate Diploma in Education as well as a Masters in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. She has also undergone International Baccalaureate’s specialised training in teaching Biology.

  

Kumutha was previously with the Science Department at Ngee Ann Secondary School. A creative and enthusiastic teacher, she strongly believes in engaging and stretching the potential of every child in the classroom. The value-added academic performance of her graduating students is testimony to her belief. She was an integral member of her department’s Action Research efforts and has presented research papers at the Educational Research Association of Singapore (ERAS) Conference and Teacher’s Network Conference in 2006.

  

Besides the Sciences, Kumutha has always been interested in dance. She received training in Bharata Natyam during her school days. Now as an educator, Kumutha aims to use the Arts as a catalyst to make the learning of Science meaningful for her students.
