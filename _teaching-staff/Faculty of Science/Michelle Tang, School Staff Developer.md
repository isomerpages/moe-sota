Michelle received her Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and Biochemistry, with Honours in Biochemistry, from the National University of Singapore, where she also completed the Special Programme in Science. Subsequently, she obtained her Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education. She has also undergone International Baccalaureateâ€™s specialised training in teaching Biology.  
  
Michelle taught at Anglo-Chinese Junior College for 12 years, where she subsequently held the appointment of Subject Head for Biology. She had the privilege to develop various curricula such as H3 Proteomics and enrichment programmes pertaining to molecular biology techniques, and was selected by MOE to participate in the Teacher's Overseas Attachment Programme where she embarked on the intensive 7-week long Rockefeller University Science Outreach Scientific Reading and Writing Program in New York City.

Michelle was appointed by MOE as an Instructional Programme Support Group (IPSG) facilitator for Biology, a role which provided and promoted opportunities for&nbsp;teachers from&nbsp;different junior colleges&nbsp;to share experiences and good teaching practices.  
  
Michelle believes very much in making Biology relevant to all aspects of everyday life. She relishes using cutting-edge science research findings to illustrate the personal and societal impact of such research. She aims to inspire a sense of awe and delight as she guides students to make links between the different facets of Biology and tease out the intricacies of how living things work and relate to each other.  
  
Besides the academia, Michelle enjoys watching performing arts events such as musicals, dance and orchestra concerts, for she finds the artistry and passion exhibited by the performers inspirational. Michelle is also interested in cooking; she views cooking as an endeavour that mixes science and art, and thus takes joy in testing and refining cooking techniques and recipes.
