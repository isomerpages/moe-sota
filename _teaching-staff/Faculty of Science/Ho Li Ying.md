Ho Li Ying graduated from National University of Singapore with a Bachelor’s Degree in Chemistry. She went on to obtain her Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore where she trained to teach Chemistry and Mathematics.

  

Li Ying accumulated four years of teaching experience in Peicai Secondary School, where she taught students from Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams, and covering both the ‘O’ level and ‘N’ level curricula during her stint. Her experience has equipped her with the skills to make use of the curricula to craft specific lesson plans to suit the learning needs and styles of classes with varied student profiles.

  

In addition, Li Ying took on the role as the School's Science enrichment coordinator, where she mentored students in Science projects and competitions, as well as organise in-house programmes during Science Week, which is targeted to link Science with daily lives.

  

As one of the recipients of the&nbsp;_Caring Staff Award_&nbsp;in Peicai Secondary School for three consecutive years, Li Ying firmly believes that in order to be an effective teacher, besides being proficient in teaching, a positive teacher-student relationship is crucial as well. As the teacher-in-charge of the modern dance club at Peicai Secondary School, besides ensuring that she was physically present during practices, she often made the effort to dance with her students and performed together with them during a school concert.

  

Li Ying has a strong passion for dance, taking up ballet at age 7, which she has since attained a RAD Grade 8 certification in. As a student, she has always been an active participant of modern dance, which she has choreographed concert items for, and is still active in pursuing till this day.
