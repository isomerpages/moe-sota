Emmeline Foo graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Science with Honours degree after obtaining a Ministry of Education Teaching Award. As an undergraduate, Emmeline was in the Special Programme in Science and the pioneer batch of the University’s Scholars Programme where she had the opportunity to study cyberarts and history. She specialised in Insect Toxicology in the Department of Biological Sciences and then moved on to obtain her Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education.

  

A student of Temasek Junior College, Emmeline’s passion for science was evident when she was selected to join the Science Research Programme at NUS where she undertook a research project that honed her appreciation for biology. As an educator, she strongly believes in hands-on experiences in teaching and specialise in designing practicals that link up closely with concepts taught in the classroom.

  

Emmeline taught for thirteen years at Meridian Junior College, guiding students in both Biology and Project Work. Together with her department, she has implemented Problem Based Learning programmes and Team Based Learning strategies to cultivate independent learning in students. Emmeline was also involved in the Information Technology department’s efforts to pioneer Technologies for Learning at a college-wide level.

  

Emmeline enjoys watching musicals and theatre performances both locally and overseas. She visits science museums and the botanical gardens whenever she can to explore the diversity of ways that science can be presented to learners. Emmeline also supports the Singapore arts scene by patronising local amateur drama groups and comedians.
