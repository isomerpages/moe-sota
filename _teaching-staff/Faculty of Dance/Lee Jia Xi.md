Lee Jia Xi has over 10 years of experience in dance education and performance, specialising in classical ballet and contemporary dance. She has worked professionally with Royal New Zealand Ballet, Singapore Dance Theatre (currently known as Singapore Ballet), and Singapore Ballet Academy. She holds a Diploma in Dance Performance awarded by New Zealand School of Dance, Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and Communication Arts, and is currently pursuing her Master’s Degree in Applied Neuroscience with King’s College London.

  

With her knowledge in neuroscience, psychology, and yoga, as a dance educator, she teaches not only movement in dance, but also the motivation and science behind the mind that creates those movements. She is interested in the intention behind what creates the authenticity and purity of movement that guides one’s behaviour, by using the discipline of the tradition she looks to guide her students to create their own future in the industry.

  

Jia Xi was awarded the Best Lead/Featured Performer at the 17th BOH Cameronian Arts Awards. As an independent dance artist, she have worked with many acclaimed local and international choreographers, artists and producers. Her unconventional works include nuclear ban campaign with dance as the main tool: “Dance for Nukeban” that was a part of the movement towards the achievement of the international “Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.” She is also a writer and copywriter for dance productions and performances.
