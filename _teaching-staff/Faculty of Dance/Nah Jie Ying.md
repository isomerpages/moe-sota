Nah Jieying started her training as an artistic gymnast and a chinese dancer. She moved on to train in contemporary dance and ballet in School of the Arts, Singapore. In 2016, she received the National Arts Council Scholarship (Undergraduate) to study overseas at London Contemporary Dance School. Upon graduating with First Class Honours, Jieying worked on projects with James Cousins Company and Matsena Productions in the United Kingdom.

  

Jieying joined The Human Expression Dance Company as a full time professional dancer from 2019-2022. She also teaches, choreographs and facilitates dance workshops and dance related talks for arts groups and organisations in Singapore.

  

Her interest lies in researching how different aspects of dancing, both physically and mentally, can bring about more body awareness and even more happiness to the rest of the community.
