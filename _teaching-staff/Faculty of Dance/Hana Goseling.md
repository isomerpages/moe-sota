As a professional dancer, Hana has worked with The Dutch National Ballet (The Netherlands), as well as Ballet Junior de Genève (Switzerland), after which she decided to study for her Master’s Degree in Dance Teacher Training (specialising in classical ballet). She obtained this Degree with Distinction at the Palucca University for Dance (Germany). During her studies Hana was part of the team behind the new production of&nbsp;_Nutcracker_&nbsp;(A.
