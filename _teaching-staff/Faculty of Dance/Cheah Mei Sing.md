Cheah Mei Sing began dancing under the tutelage of Goh Soo Khim at the Singapore Ballet Academy. She was awarded the inaugural Shell-National Arts Council Arts Scholarship which enabled her to complete her studies at the prestigious Australian Ballet School in 1994.


As a professional dancer, Mei Sing performed and toured extensively with the Singapore Dance Theatre (SDT) from 1995 to 2007. She served as Rehearsal Assistant for several of SDT's productions. In 2002, Mei Sing hosted the popular Arts Central dance series 'Go Tutu Go', and facilitated Esplanade's dialogue sessions with dance legends Misty Copeland, Sylvie Guillem, Yuri Fateev (The Maryiinsky Ballet) and Brigitte Lefèvre (The Paris Opera Ballet).


Mei Sing attained her teaching certification with The Royal Academy of Dance (UK). Her students have gone on to pursue careers in dance, of which several have been awarded the National Arts Council Scholarship to further their education. They have graduated from English National Ballet School, New Zealand School of Dance, The Julliard School (to name a few) and danced professionally with the Singapore Dance Theatre, T.H.E Dance Company (SGP), Universal Ballet (Kor), and Hubbard Street Dance 2 (USA) to name a few.


Having lectured and assessed at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LaSalle College of the Arts, Mei Sing has conducted teacher’s workshops locally and accepted guest teaching opportunities overseas (Hong Kong and United States of America). Since 2013, she has advised with the People's Association Talent Development Committee and chaired the World Dance Alliance’s Workshop committee during its 2015’s Asia-Pacific Dance Bridge. Mei Sing has adjudicated dance competitions both locally and internationally, serving as jury member for the Asian Grand Prix Classical Ballet Competition held in Hong Kong. In 2018, she served as member of the 2018 Cultural Medallion and Young Artist Award (CMYAA) Specialist Panel for Dance.


As the former Head of Dance at the School of the Arts Singapore (SOTA), Mei Sing remains actively involved in the arts as a member of their Dance Faculty.
