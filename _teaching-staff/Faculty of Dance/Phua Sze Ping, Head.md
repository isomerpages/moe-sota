After graduating from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Applied Science (Honours) in Biotechnology, Phua Sze Ping decided to pursue her first love - dance. She started teaching dance, and earned herself a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Dance Education from the Royal Academy of Dance, United Kingdom, and University of Surrey, United Kingdom.

  

Prior to joining SOTA, Sze Ping co-founded and co-owned local dance studio, Attitude Performing Arts Studio. She also taught dance theory part-time at Lasalle College of the Arts, Singapore. From time to time, she supervised and mentored trainee teachers in the teaching programme offered by the Royal Academy of Dance.

  

Sze Ping enjoys immersing herself in dance and dance-related activities, and exploring various methods of dance education.

  

More recently, she attained a Master of Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where the focus of her study was on the arts in education. Sze Ping also had the opportunity to broaden her interest in dance by studying dance improvisation with Jill Johnson during her time at Harvard.

  

Sze Ping is also a STOTT PILATES Certified Instructor for Matwork and Reformer (Level 1).
