Katrina graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in Mathematics from the National University of Singapore. She went on to pursue a Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. She has also undergone International Baccalaureateâ€™s specialised training in teaching Mathematics.

  

She began her career in education as a Mathematics and Computer Applications teacher in Anderson Secondary School in 2001. Since then, she has tried to infuse creativity into the teaching of Mathematics by incorporating activities such as song writing, poem writing and comic strip drawing into the learning of the subject. She was appointed Acting Head for Pupil Welfare Department in 2005, where she oversaw orientation activities and headed student development programmes such as service learning and career guidance.

  

She is also a trained teacher-counsellor. Besides imparting knowledge to students, Katrina strongly believes that character building is the foundation to the all-rounded development of students.

  

Katrina enjoys Broadway musicals and theatre performances. She hopes to be able to craft a unique Mathematics curriculum that helps students see the link between Mathematics and the Arts.
