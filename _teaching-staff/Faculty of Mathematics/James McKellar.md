James graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Aeronautical Engineering from Salford University in the UK. After working in the British Armed Forces, he took his Postgraduate Certificate in Education at Christchurch University, Canterbury where he gained his teaching qualification in Mathematics and Information technology. He then pursued his education further and achieved his Masters in Mathematics.

  

After teaching in a grammar and a boarding school in the UK, he came to Singapore in 2003 to teach and worked in the same international school for 18 years. He gained a wealth of experience in the International Baccalaureate, helping the school achieve its IB world school status. He has held the roles of Head of Faculty, Head of Houses and Head of 6th Form Mathematics. His role before joining SOTA was Assistant Head of Faculty, with responsibilities for A Level and Further Mathematics. He has a wealth of experience in education with teaching IGCE, IB, A Levels and Further Mathematics.

Jamesâ€™ philosophy of teaching and lifelong learning is that one should be trying to make mathematics as entertaining as possible, as well as relevant to the modern world. Often using maths in many different contexts and looking for the cross over into other branches of education. With the visual arts and music having so much mathematics, he encourages his students to look deeper at the mathematics and the connections it makes with the art forms. He also plays the drums.  
  
James is a Member of the Institute of Mathematics (UK), the Mathematics Association (UK) and the Chartered Institute of Educational Assessors.
