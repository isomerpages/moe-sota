Ko Hak Chin graduated with a Bachelor of Science (majoring in Physics) from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and went on to receive her Postgraduate Diploma in Education as well as a Master in Education (Guidance and Counselling) from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore.

  

Hak Chin began her teaching career at Boon Lay Secondary School and moved on to Fuhua Secondary School (FHSS) as Head of Department (Pastoral Care and Career Guidance, PCCG). Being one of the pioneer staff of FHSS, she spearheaded the PCCG department and planned the PCCG curriculum, programmes and structure for the school. Wanting to challenge herself, she joined Raffles Girls’ School (Secondary) (RGS) and is a trained Gifted Education Programme teacher, Strength Quest coach and Community Problem Solving (CmPS) coach. She was appointed the Year 4 Head, and subsequently Assistant Head (Mathematics). Being one of the pioneers of the Raffles Integrated Programme, she was one of the heads in shaping the Character and Leadership Education programme and Mathematics programme in RGS. She introduced Mathematical Modelling to the school and subsequently to other secondary schools in the cluster. After being in the Raffles Integrated Programme for 14 years, she wanted to see a different Integrated Programme, and joined Nanyang Girls’ High (Secondary) as the Secondary 4 Year Head and Subject Head (Mathematics).

  

When Hak Chin was a student, she was in the MOE Art Elective Programme, and enjoyed painting and handicraft work. Being a Mathematics teacher, her passion for Art does not stop - she sees a close relationship between Art and Mathematics, and hopes to inspire students to see the beauty of Mathematics in Art.
