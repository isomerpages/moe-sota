Winnie Gwee graduated with a Bachelor of Science (majoring in Mathematics) from the National University of Singapore and she obtained her Postgraduate Diploma in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. Passionate in the teaching and learning of Mathematics, she obtained her Masters of Education in 2009 with her major paper on “Using Open Ended Questions to Engage and Challenge Mathematically Gifted Students” and Doctorate of Education with her thesis on “Learning Geometry using a Virtual Reality 3 Computer Program” in 2013 from the University of Western Australia.

  

From 2003 to 2004, Winnie taught Mathematics at Dunearn Secondary School and she joined Hwa Chong Institution in 2005, where she held the appointment of Principal Consultant (Mathematics) since 2013.

  

She is trained in School Based Gifted Education and has taught Math Olympiad and Research Skills in Mathematics. She also has strong interest in research and is experienced in mentoring students for Mathematics projects and has won several awards in Singapore Science and Engineering Festival (SSEF) and Singapore Mathematics Projects Festival (SMPF).

  

Winnie has contributed articles in various publications and she has presented her papers in both local and overseas conferences. She has also been invited to conduct teacher workshops on Mentoring Projects at AME-SMS Mathematics Teachers’ Conference and Academy of Singapore Teachers and student workshops on Mathematics and Origami. In addition, she serves as the Assistant Editor for Singapore Mathematical Society and is the National Director for Australian Mathematics Trust, Australian Mathematics Competition, Singapore.

  

In her school days, Winnie played in the Concert Band as a percussionist. She also plays the piano and improvises with bossa nova and jazz. With her strong Music and Mathematics background, Winnie enjoys making connections between the two disciplines and sees Mathematics as an Art. She would like to inspire the way students use and learn Mathematics and hope that they, too, would appreciate Mathematics as an Art.
