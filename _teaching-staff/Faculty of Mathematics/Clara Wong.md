Clara holds a Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences Degree (Merit) in Psychology and Mathematics from the National University of Singapore. She went on to obtain her Postgraduate Diploma in Education as well as her Masters of Education (Gifted Education) from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore.

Clara began her teaching career in Clementi Town Secondary School (CTSS). She was the teacher in charge of the CTSS Concert Band, which was later named the CTSS Symphonic Band. She led the band on an overseas exchange program. She believes that taking students out of their familiar surroundings allow them to gain experience and develop maturity. She attained the ABRSM Grade 8 Piano. Her love for music led to the collaboration between CTSS Symphonic Band and CTSS Choir during a Speech Day performance.

Throughout her teaching years in several secondary schools, Clara mentored new teachers and had been a Secondary 3 Normal Academic Math and Sec 3 Additional Math level coordinator.

Clara strongly believes that a teacher more than imparts knowledge. A classroom is a place where students learn moral values, develop character qualities and life skills too.
