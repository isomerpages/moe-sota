Soo Ling received her Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences from the National University of Singapore, majoring in Mathematics and Japanese Studies. This was followed by her Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Merit) from the National Institute of Education (NIE, NTU). She had been trained as a Mathematics and Science student in school, moving on to the arts and social sciences at tertiary level had been an enhanced experience to her in her perspectives towards holistic education experiences.

  

Since her teaching journey started in 1994, while immersing herself in several mainstream as well as independent schools, Soo Ling has enjoyed her vast exposure to various curriculum and a wide spectrum of student profiles. During her appointment as the Subject Head for Youth Leadership in Bukit Batok Secondary School (BBSS), she helmed the Project Mi (Rice) with all the uniformed groups and piloted the No Shoe Day with World Vision, the first ever to be organised in a secondary school. Moving on to Queenstown Secondary School (QTSS) as the Subject Head for Mathematics in 2014, she implemented the newly launched Subject Based Banding (SBB) system. Being from a successful pilot school (QTSS) for SBB, she was also actively involved in the mentoring of other schools in the zone from 2015 to 2018. She piloted the Blood Donation Drive in QTSS and had been its key organiser from 2015 to 2019. She believes holistic school experience must be a concoction of academic; value-building, especially empathy and integrity; leadership and passion.
