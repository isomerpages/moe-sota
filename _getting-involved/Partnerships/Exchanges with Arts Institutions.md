SOTA establishes and maintains close links with local and overseas arts institutions to engage in arts education exchanges, dialogue, sharing of good practices and provision of higher education pathways for our students.  


We work closely with local institutions such as the LASALLE College of the Arts, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music and have obtained the support of overseas arts institutions for our International Baccalaureate Careers-related Programme and other collaborative exchanges.
