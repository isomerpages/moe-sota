Arts and culture are integral to Singapore, and arts education is a key catalyst in shaping the future cultural landscape. With a vision to nurture creative citizens for the future who positively impact Singapore and the world, the School of the Arts, Singapore (SOTA) believes in providing a conducive and vibrant learning environment that is anchored in the arts.  
  
The&nbsp;**SOTA Endowment Fund**&nbsp;addresses the need for long-term sustainability in providing our students with bursaries, scholarships and other financial assistance. With your help, this Fund shall help us to make arts education accessible for the less privileged.  
  
Every gift matters. Your contribution to this Fund will play a significant role in nurturing our cultural leaders of tomorrow. We thank you in advance for your generous support!

### Why donate to the Fund?

No child who is talented and shows passion in the arts should be deprived of an education anchored in the arts due to financial disadvantage.

### How will your donations help?

A SOTA student spends an average of&nbsp;**S$7,700**&nbsp;a year on school necessities such as school fees, books, art form materials, transport, meals and school uniforms. The fund provides financial assistance to students who face financial hardship so that they may focus on their studies.
