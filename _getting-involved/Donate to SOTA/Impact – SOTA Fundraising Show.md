### ABOUT IMPACT

_Impact_&nbsp;is an annual fundraising show that is organised by School of the Arts, Singapore (SOTA) to raise funds for the SOTA Endowment Fund (SEF).  
  
Like the roots of a tree, the SEF was set up in 2019 to serve as a strong foundation towards growing a self-sustainable source of funds for the school in providing our students with bursaries, scholarships and other financial assistance. The fund ensures that SOTA’s unique arts education remains accessible so that no child gets left behind due to financial disadvantage.  
  
Supporting our school’s vision to nurture the next generation of cultural leaders who positively impact society, the annual fundraising show draws inspiration from a Singaporean cultural leader who has made significant contributions in shaping Singapore’s arts and cultural landscape. Young aspiring artists at SOTA are encouraged to learn from the stories and works of these pioneers, in turn creating new and original works for the show.  
  
Featuring Dance, Film, Literary Arts, Music, Theatre, and Visual Arts works by the SOTA community,&nbsp;_Impact_&nbsp;is a carefully crafted multidisciplinary showcase that is cohesive and rich in meaning. It is a celebration of everything that makes the SOTA education experience unique.

### IMPACT 2022

<u>Synopsis</u>

  
IMPACT 2022 is a vibrant multidisciplinary performance experience, featuring entirely original works created by SOTA students, alumni and staff. This showcase features Dance, Film, Literary Arts, Music, Theatre and Visual Arts, including many interdisciplinary collaborations.  
  
We promise you an evening of inspiration and stimulation as we explore the themes and sensibilities of the artist Tang Da Wu, who is a spirited artist of many mediums. As an educator and activist, he has inspired generations of artists of different disciplines with his experimental and pioneering vision. In 1988, Tang Da Wu founded The Artists Village and continues to be an iconic figure for the local artistic community today.  
  
Come enjoy an evening of striking sights and sounds, centred on themes of nature and identity, in a warm communal meeting place of tradition, experimentation and innovation. Our students, alumni and staff have spent many months drawing inspiration from Tang Da Wu's life and work, in order to bring this memorable experience to you.
