At SOTA, all students go through a six-year integrated arts and academic curriculum. Our holistic approach ensures each student acquires a valuable set of skills that span the academic, artistic and affective. The programme culminates in an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma or an IB Career-related Programme.  
  
The guiding principle of our curriculum is to build connections between the different subject areas as well as bridge theory with practice to develop artistic dispositions, critical thinking and heightened creative awareness. By focusing on the process of learning, we promote experimentation, expression and discovery in both arts and academic arenas. Students also benefit from close mentorship by teachers and from programmes and platforms that develop them into leaders with Humility, Integrity, People-centredness and Passion (H.I.P.P).
