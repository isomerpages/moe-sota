### D:2 Dance Competition

In January, Year 5 Dance students Low Su Jing and Sheryl Chew participated in the finals of the D:2 Dance Competition. The competition encourages young aspiring dancers to unleash their creativity by fusing traditional Singapore dance culture with other genres. Combining Chinese and contemporary dance, Su Jing and Sheryl’s performance clinched them the consolation award in Category A.

### 13-19 Art Prize

Year 6 Visual Arts student Huang Luxiang Andrew clinched the Silver award at the inaugural 13-19 Art Prize, a nationwide competition that recognises and celebrates young art talents in Singapore. 

His mixed media-on-canvas work titled Focus is inspired by the visual qualities of Singapore’s HDB flats, such as their closely stacked living spaces and crowded neighbourhoods. Andrew’s work and the rest of the winning art pieces were put up for auction, with proceeds going to The Business Times Budding Artists Fund.
