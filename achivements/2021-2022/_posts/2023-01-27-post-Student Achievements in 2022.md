### 13-19 Art Prize

Year 6 Visual Arts student Huang Luxiang Andrew clinched the Silver award at the inaugural 13-19 Art Prize, a nationwide competition that recognises and celebrates young art talents in Singapore. 

His mixed media-on-canvas work titled Focus is inspired by the visual qualities of Singapore’s HDB flats, such as their closely stacked living spaces and crowded neighbourhoods. Andrew’s work and the rest of the winning art pieces were put up for auction, with proceeds going to The Business Times Budding Artists Fund.

### Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize

Since 2010, SOTA’s Music students have been invited to perform at the biennial Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize. In April 2022, SOTA’s Wind Ensemble and Percussion students opened the event with Naoya Wada’s “Flower Crown”, a piece reminiscing the Japanese tradition of making ornamental hairpins.&nbsp;

The performance was conducted by Mr Lee Jin Jun from the Music faculty. IBCP students Joshua Lau (Year 6) and Regan Ho (Year 5) also starred in the highlight performance, playing two short works based on the Malay folk tunes “Ikan Kekek” and “Suriram”.

### 2021 “Feed My Trashemon” School Competition

Visual Arts students Liew Li Yu Jade (Year 2) and Justin Teo (Year 3) participated in the&nbsp; 2021 “Feed My Trashemon” School Competition and were placed among the top 10 finalists of the competition. They attended the award ceremony in April and received their awards from Guest of Honour Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment. The bins designed by them were also placed around SOTA campus.&nbsp;

Organised by the Public Hygiene Council in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the competition invited students to showcase their creativity and design monster bins, or “Trashemons”, that promote cleaner habits among Singaporeans. The designs aim to encourage members of the community to “feed” the bins and dispose of their litter appropriately.&nbsp;

A big congratulations once again to our students!
