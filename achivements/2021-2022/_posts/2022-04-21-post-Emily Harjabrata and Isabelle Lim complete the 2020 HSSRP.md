Last year, Year 4 Literary Arts students Emily Harjabrata and Isabelle Lim successfully completed the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Programme (HSSRP) 2020. From conducting their own research studies to submitting proposals, the girls had the opportunity to engage in research under the guidance of mentors and deepen their understanding of the Humanities and Social Sciences through this nine-month programme.  
   
Isabelle shares, "Despite the obstacles that came with COVID-19, HSSRP was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to construct my own research. Working with my Professor and teacher-mentor allowed me to take away many good tips for research that will surely help me in the future."  
   
Emily echoed Isabelle’s sentiments, “It was fun conducting my own study and writing a paper on it and I felt a sense of fulfilment and satisfaction after completing the programme.”  
   
We are proud to see our students embrace diverse learning experiences and develop a passion for independent learning. Well done girls!
